COMPREHENSIVE POC EXPLORATION PROCESS - INTRODUCTION FOR PRODUCT & ENGINEERING TEAMS

OVERVIEW:

Following initial documentation of the Conditions Portal POC at https://conditions-portal-pr-ahby.bolt.host/, a comprehensive systematic exploration was conducted to capture every screen, interaction, and feature available in the application. This deep-dive exploration uncovered 11 additional critical screens and workflows beyond the initial 4 major features documented, including: loan status submission with rich text notes, document sourcing from CLEAR Docs, inline note-taking, role-based filter variations, personal flag systems, custom condition creation, saved condition lists ("My Lists"), and the complete 150+ condition template library organized across 20+ categories. The exploration also revealed important role-switching behavior where Processor and Underwriter views have distinctly different filter sets (5 filters vs 2 filters) optimized for their specific workflows, as well as inline editing patterns that minimize modal usage for quick actions like adding notes or editing loan descriptions.

DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE:

Two complementary HTML documents have been created: "tract-01-dependency-management.html" provides the strategic framework for breaking down large projects using a three-tier approach (Platform → Roles → Features) to minimize dependencies and enable parallel development, complete with visual dependency flows, ticket templates, and scaffolding tables. "tract-01-detailed-features.html" provides granular technical specifications extracted directly from the POC, documenting every field, dropdown option, button, modal, accordion section, and workflow discovered through systematic exploration, complete with 20 embedded screenshots showing each screen and interaction. Together, these documents provide both the strategic "how to structure work" guidance and the tactical "here's exactly what exists and what needs to be built" specifications needed to implement the Conditions Portal with confidence.

VALUE FOR TEAMS:

Product teams can use the dependency management tract to create GitHub issues that minimize blocking dependencies, allowing multiple developers to work in parallel while maintaining clear acceptance criteria and integration points. Engineering teams can reference the detailed features document as a living specification that captures not just the happy-path features but also the discovered edge cases, accordion sections, inline editors, role permissions, and integration touchpoints (CLEAR Docs, Byte API) that emerged during exploration. The systematic documentation of 35+ tickets across platform, processor features, underwriter features, borrower-facing features, and notification/integration features provides a complete backlog with size estimates and key components identified, dramatically reducing the ambiguity and discovery work typically required when translating a POC into production-ready tickets.

NEXT STEPS:

Teams should review both HTML documents together (linked for easy navigation), validate the discovered features against business requirements, identify any additional screens or workflows not captured in the POC, and use the provided ticket structure as a starting point for sprint planning. The "My Lists" feature and 150+ condition templates represent significant domain knowledge that should be validated with mortgage operations experts to ensure completeness and accuracy before implementation.
