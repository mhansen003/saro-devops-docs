- **Tags vs. Flags Discussion**:
  - Concern about flag/tag sprawl if public
  - If personal (persistent), less concern about constraints
  - Decision: Start with flags, can expand to tags if needed
  - Monitor for patterns to standardize

1.7 INTEGRATION POINTS
-----------------------
- **Byte LOS Integration**:
  - Opens within Byte via web control
  - Receives loan context from Byte
  - Bidirectional sync with ~30 second acceptable delay
  - Conditions Portal is source of truth for its data
  - Rollback/recovery mechanism needed for conflicts

- **Clear Docs Integration**:
  - Shared document repository and management
  - Embedded as tab within Conditions Portal
  - Same browser window, not side-by-side

- **Candor Integration** (Jina Choi lead):
  - Automated condition creation based on AUS results
  - OCR-based document verification and clearance
  - Acts as "mock underwriter" for automated processing
  - Creates conditions that Candor signs off on
  - Carlos Sanchez as CMG conduit for Candor

- **Borrower Needs List**:
  - Existing tool to be wired into Conditions Portal
  - Email functionality should be unified

1.8 ROLES & PERMISSIONS (HIGH PRIORITY - COMPLEX)
--------------------------------------------------
**Target: 5-7 base roles** (consolidate from 400+ Byte roles)

**Base Roles Identified**:
1. **Loan Officer (LO)** - View conditions, limited actions
2. **LO Assistant** - May be identical to LO (need clarification)
3. **Processor** (multiple types in Byte):
   - Loan Processor
   - Processor 2
   - Processor 3 (can sign off on processor-level conditions)
4. **Underwriter** (multiple types):
   - Different exception request permissions
   - Can create conditions, sign off on conditions
   - Don't link docs to conditions (processors do that)
5. **Post-Underwriting Roles**:
   - Closers (wet state vs dry state distinction needed)
   - Funders
   - Post-Closing team
   - QC (Quality Control)

**Permission Concepts**:
- **Class-Based Permissions**: If condition class matches user role, full access
  - Processor can modify any field if condition class = "Processor"
  - Underwriter can modify if condition class = "Underwriter"

- **Field-Level Controls**:
  - Description field: Controlled by "editable" flag at template level
    - Not editable: No one can edit description
    - Editable: Everyone can edit description
    - Custom Question: CMG will start using this
  - Responsibility field: **REMOVING ACCESS** per Kelly/Byte team
  - Candor will use "Transaction" field instead of "Responsibility"

- **Stage Movement**:
  - Processors can move conditions to PTF (Prior to Funding)
  - Can move conditions between stages based on permissions

- **Condition Operations by Role**:
  - Create condition
  - Edit condition details
  - Link documents to condition
  - Change status
  - Clear/satisfy condition
  - Request documents from borrower

**Open Items**:
- Create role/permissions matrix (Josephine/Lauren) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Map 400+ Byte roles to 7-8 base Conditions Portal roles (Andrew)
- Confirm closer vs. funder role distinctions (Kelly/Lauren)
- Exception Requests functionality deep dive (Product/Kelly)

**Key Principle**: Only add new roles when there's a DIFFERENCE in functionality
- Don't create multiple roles if they have identical permissions
- Minimize complexity while supporting all use cases

1.9 DOWNSTREAM DEPARTMENT SUPPORT
----------------------------------
**Requirement**: Support post-underwriting roles (funders, closers, post-closing, QC)

**Challenge**: These teams support all channels and can't be isolated to beta
- Can't create beta group that only sees new system
- Hybrid approach needed

**Solution Approach**:
- Minimize to ~7 base roles that map from 400+ Byte roles
- Support full value chain from LO to post-closing
- Ensure no new unique functionality requirements from downstream
  - Confirmed they do same operations: move conditions, clear conditions, etc.
  - Use same base permissions with different access profiles

================================================================================
2. API & TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

2.1 API ENDPOINTS
-----------------
**Identified API Calls** (from Josephine's data model work):

- **GET /loan-conditions**: Landing screen data
  - Returns all conditions for a loan
  - Includes condition details, status, linked documents
  - Schema defined in Josephine's spreadsheet

- **GET /condition-list**: List of condition templates
  - Available condition types
  - Template definitions

- **Condition Operations**:
  - Create condition
  - Update condition
  - Delete condition (likely)
  - Link/unlink documents
  - Change status
  - Add notes

2.2 DATA MODEL
--------------
**Key Data Model Decisions**:

1. **Many-to-Many Document-Condition Relationship**:
   - **DEVIATION FROM BYTE** (Byte is 1:1)
   - Single document can link to multiple conditions
   - Requires reconciliation logic
   - More flexible and realistic workflow

2. **Condition Fields**:
   - Condition ID
   - Description
   - Category
   - Status
   - Stage (Prior to Docs, Funding, Closing, Post-Closing)
   - Class (Processor, Underwriter, etc.)
   - Transaction field (replaces Responsibility)
   - Linked documents (array)
   - Notes (array with metadata)
   - Flags (user-specific)
   - Created by/date
   - Modified by/date (API shows server time, not individual user)

3. **Editable Flag at Template Level**:
   - Controls description field editability
   - Set when condition template is created
   - Three options: Not Editable, Editable, Custom Question

4. **Hybrid Data Storage**:
   - Core condition data lives in Byte
   - Additional metadata lives in Clear database
   - Full dataset = Byte data + Clear metadata (A + B)
   - API merges data from both sources to render UI
   - Must sync minimum Byte data to maintain Domo reports

2.3 BYTE API INTEGRATION
-------------------------
**Challenges**:
- API user attribution issue: Shows system account, not individual user
- Modified datetime: Server time used when API updates, user time when UI updates
- No history tracking in Byte (only current status, not status history)
- ~30 second bidirectional sync delay is acceptable

**Sync Strategy**:
- Conditions Portal writes to Clear database
- Sync relevant data back to Byte
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Support existing Domo reports

2.4 AUDIT & LOGGING
-------------------
**Requirements**:
- Log ALL changes to conditions
  - Who made the change
  - What changed
  - When it changed
  - Why (if applicable - notes)

- **Audit Events**:
  - Condition created
  - Condition edited (field-level tracking)
  - Status changed
  - Document linked/unlinked
  - Note added
  - Condition cleared
  - Flag added/removed

- **Audit Access**:
  - Domo reports for audit trail
  - May not need dedicated audit UI in Clear
  - Full data set required for rendering UI and auditing

- **Purpose**: Regulatory compliance, troubleshooting, accountability

2.5 AUTO-SAVE & REAL-TIME UPDATES
----------------------------------
- No explicit save button
- Terminal actions trigger saves (accept, clear, reject, close)
- Real-time updates to UI when changes made
- Conflict resolution needed for concurrent edits

================================================================================
3. OPEN QUESTIONS & ISSUES
================================================================================

3.1 HIGH PRIORITY
-----------------
1. **Role/Permissions Matrix** (Josephine/Lauren)
   - Define exactly what each of 7-8 roles can do
   - Create Excel spreadsheet with permissions
   - Due: TBD (end of January for requirements)

2. **Byte Role Mapping** (Andrew - new employee)
   - Map 400+ Byte roles to 7-8 Conditions Portal base roles
   - Critical for security model
   - Due: TBD

3. **"Responsibility" Field Removal Impact** (Jina Choi/Kelly)
   - Candor dependency on this field
   - Coordinate with Byte team
   - Use "Transaction" field instead
   - Due: ASAP

4. **Exception Requests Deep Dive** (Product/Kelly)
   - How do exception requests work?
   - Different permissions for underwriter roles based on exceptions
   - Impacts role definition
   - Due: TBD

5. **Auto-Run Conditions Engine Trigger** (Product/Kelly)
   - On loan open automatically, or button click?
   - Performance implications
   - User experience considerations
   - Due: TBD

6. **Loan-Level Beta Flag** (Rusty/Engineering)
   - Flag to identify "Conditions Portal loans" vs legacy
   - Allows hybrid operation during rollout

   - Due: TBD

3.2 MEDIUM PRIORITY
-------------------
7. **Document Description Field in Split/Merge** (Tim/Engineering)
   - Confirm field is available during document operations
   - Due: TBD

8. **Closer vs Funder Role Distinction** (Kelly/Lauren)
   - Wet state vs dry state differences
   - Permissions differences
   - Due: TBD

9. **Kelly's "Cardinal Rules"** (Leslie/Tim)
   - Document constraints and requirements from Byte team
   - Critical for compatibility
   - Due: TBD

10. **AI Document Auto-Indexing** (Leslie)
    - Add Sato's document indexing tool to requirements
    - Integration point
    - Due: End of January

11. **Email System Unification**
    - Consolidate email across Conditions Portal, Needs List, Tasks, Clear Docs
    - Single email screen for all experiences
    - Auto-reminders controlling all doc requests
    - Owner: Product/Engineering

12. **Custom Conditions Governance**
    - Allow users to create custom conditions
    - Monitor for patterns to standardize
    - Balance flexibility vs. standardization
    - Risk: Undermines governance if uncontrolled

================================================================================
4. TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE
================================================================================

| # | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|---|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Documents can link to multiple conditions** | More realistic workflow, single doc can satisfy multiple requirements | Deviation from Byte 1:1; needs reconciliation logic |
| 2 | **Flags are user-specific, not global** | Personal organization tool, not communication mechanism | Simplifies data model, no flag management needed |
| 3 | **Remove "Responsibility" field** | Per Byte team direction | Candor uses "Transaction" field instead |
| 4 | **Enhanced notes system** | Single blob insufficient | Structured notes with timestamps, user attribution, read/unread |
| 5 | **No save button - auto-save** | Modern UX pattern | Terminal actions trigger saves |
| 6 | **Kill email tabs feature** | Simplify UI | Single email generation, not multiple versions in tabs |
| 7 | **Build in Clear, accessible from Byte** | Follow existing pattern | Like Clear Docs, Pipeline - embedded via web control |
| 8 | **Support downstream roles** | Minimize disruption | ~7 base roles map from 400+ Byte roles |
| 9 | **Hybrid data storage** | Byte compatibility + new features | Condition in Byte, metadata in Clear |
| 10 | **Sync to Byte for Domo reports** | Don't break existing analytics | Maintain backward compatibility |
| 11 | **Audit logging required** | Regulatory and troubleshooting | Log all changes with full metadata |

================================================================================
5. ROLLOUT STRATEGY
================================================================================

5.1 PHASED BETA APPROACH
------------------------
**Goal**: Minimize disruption while enabling thorough testing

**Approach**:
1. **Create loan-level flag** in Byte
   - Identifies "Conditions Portal loans" vs legacy
   - Similar to GFE/Loan Estimate toggle pattern

2. **Select pilot group**
   - FULL value chain: LOs, processors, underwriters, closers, funders, post-closing
   - Avoid mid-loan handoff issues
   - Problem: Some roles support all channels (can't isolate them)

3. **Hybrid operation**
   - Modify Byte conditions button to check loan flag
   - Opens legacy or new portal based on flag
   - Users may work in both systems depending on loan assignment
   - Data stays synchronized between both

4. **Beta considerations**:
   - Downstream departments (post-closing, QC, funders) support all loans
   - Can't isolate them to only beta loans
   - Need loan-level flag so they see appropriate UI per loan
   - Existing pipeline must remain operational

5. **Monitor and fix**
   - Run pilot for ~1 month
   - Gather feedback
   - Fix issues
   - Company-wide rollout

5.2 RISK MITIGATION
-------------------
- **Byte auto-save conflicts**: Implement rollback/recovery; Conditions Portal is source of truth
- **Role complexity**: Consolidate to 5-7 base roles with mapping at login
- **Downstream disruption**: Loan-level flag allows users to see both systems based on loan
- **Data sync**: API handles sync; audit logging; Domo joins both sources
- **Candor dependency**: Coordinate on "Responsibility" field removal, use "Transaction" instead

================================================================================
6. WORKFLOW RULES & BUSINESS LOGIC
================================================================================

6.1 CONDITION LIFECYCLE
-----------------------
1. **Creation**:
   - Automatic via Rules Engine (based on loan attributes)
   - Manual by underwriter
   - Via Candor (AUS-triggered)

2. **Assignment**:
   - Grouped by stage (Prior to Docs, Funding, Closing, Post-Closing)
   - Categorized (App, Credit, Bar, Internal, External)
   - Class assigned (Processor, Underwriter, etc.)

3. **Processing**:
   - Processor uploads/links documents
   - Processor requests documents from borrower (if Bar dependency)
   - Documents can be split, merged, rotated
   - Documents can link to multiple conditions

4. **Review**:
   - Underwriter reviews linked documents
   - Can accept or reject
   - Can add notes for clarification
   - Wizard mode guides step-by-step

5. **Clearance**:
   - Appropriate role clears condition based on class
   - Status changes to "Cleared"
   - Audit trail created
   - Can be undone if needed (check permissions)

6. **Stage Progression**:
   - Conditions move through stages as loan progresses
   - Prior to Docs → Prior to Funding → Prior to Closing → Post-Closing
   - Stage movement controlled by permissions

6.2 DOCUMENT REQUEST WORKFLOW
------------------------------
1. **Identify needed documents**
   - Review conditions with Bar dependency
   - Status: "Need Bar Request"

2. **Generate borrower email**:
   - Select conditions needing documents
   - Click "Send Bar Request"
   - AI generates email with selected tone
   - Can regenerate with different tone
   - Can use saved template

3. **Send and track**:
   - Email sent to borrower
   - Status changes to "Requested"
   - Document request history maintained
   - Auto-reminders trigger at configured intervals

4. **Document receipt**:
   - Borrower uploads document
   - Status changes to "Received" or "Active"
   - Document appears in Clear Docs
   - Processor links document to conditions

5. **Acceptance workflow**:
   - Review document
   - Accept, reject, or request clarification
   - Update condition status accordingly

6.3 RULES ENGINE WORKFLOW
--------------------------
1. **Trigger**: Loan opened OR button clicked (TBD)
2. **Examine**: Loan attributes (loan type, property type, borrower info, etc.)
3. **Apply Rules**: Match loan characteristics to condition templates
4. **Generate**: Create applicable conditions automatically
5. **Remove**: Remove conditions that no longer apply (if loan attributes change)
6. **Group**: Organize by stage and category

**Example Rules**:
- If loan type = FHA → Add FHA-specific conditions
- If property type = Condo → Add condo certification requirements
- If self-employed borrower → Add income verification conditions
- If high LTV → Add additional documentation requirements
