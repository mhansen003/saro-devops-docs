[1:15:44] Leslie Chang: Final stamp and and so even if you sent the loan, let's say you've partially underwrote the loan and you you had like 8 docs that were good. You'd final stamp those. They're locked, but the other three go back to the processor. That way the processor can go fix that, but they can't actually change what was there that way the underwriter has.Peace of Mind, and they don't feel like they have to re underwrite the entire file because if it's screen checked only underwriters can uncheck it. So anyway
