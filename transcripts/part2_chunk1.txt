Leslie Chang started transcription
Leslie Chang   0:03So um identify bar docs to request update descriptions, AI bar request e-mail request non bar related docs. OK we're striking this, yeah.OK, so now I'm the processor. The loan has been approved by the underwriter and now I need to request my documents that have a bar dependency. So these are the BRW.Conditions. So let's see. I have a couple that say need bar request and you can see the status here need bar request and then so this button here send bar request. If you click on this, it's also I guess a wizard if you want to refer to it as that.So it'll filter by app and then also by B1B2, and then you can also filter the list specifically by app 1B1, not B2CB1CB1. Yes, yeah, by application.Right up to three and app representing both borrowers borrower and and this is the borrower needs list. This is this software exists already over on the 1003 screen. The only difference here is that this has added the display of the condition.The the condition description, Yeah, in the filter list. Yeah, it'll be wired to a condition. Yeah, because it's wired to a condition. One thing, one of the things that underwriters, I mean processors really wanted to see when they're creating these.Descriptions is the actual under air condition. It's lined up with what the under writer's actually.So what this is allowing us to do is generate an e-mail that will go to the bar requesting anything that has a bar dependency on it. So if we're asking for like pay stubs or bank statements or something like that. So anything that has need bar request status next to the condition.You'll notice it will be incremented in this counter, so we have like about 7 from what I can tell that need a bar request. So if you click this for clarity that button is document requests and not. So while the condition says borrow request, that's an easy way to identify.That's the status of the condition that's waiting on something from the borrower. The the button is looking at the stuff in the doc request column, which is a little further to the right because you may have can have multiple requests per condition, so they may have.So one condition might have a request for the borrower and one for the co-borrower. It's possible just just four minutes and you can deselect if there's certain conditions that you don't want to send the e-mail.And you click Add 7 to e-mail. And So what this is, is basically drafting you an e-mail similar to bar needs. So you'll have a salutation and intro. It'll list all of the documents that are being requested.We have the signature for the loan officer. You can also if you have a custom e-mail card, you can click Set e-mail signature.That's OK. Um, so I mean, you get the idea you, yeah.I think that e-mail that's spaced, you know, I remember when I thought of it, you didn't have that. OK, but you could only edit the modal mess again. You know she's too has to edit. That's it's not live now. It's being done by Brandon.But whatever's, they're also just seen that so wherever that. So we'll be using that, take that from the borrower's needs list, yeah, right. And then enhancing it 'cause it's missing some some features that we wanna have like the AI.The ability to create multiple AI versions, the ability to manage the needs, the ability to accept the e-mail signature and Leslie, if you refresh the set e-mail signature.Before I do that, we'll just start from the top to the bottom. So from is basically the current user. So whoever the current user is going to the e-mail is going to be sent from their e-mail address to will be all the bars on the loan you can.Remove them if you want and you can also add e-mail addresses manually. CC is the production assist. Sorry, I'm sorry, yeah.Everybody's application there or is that it's auto populated. It's auto populated the two whatever you pick on the book. It's it's basically if you it's gonna grab all the borrowers that have an item for their OK so if you have just.Stuff that you've added in the e-mail that are coming from the bar. We'll just follow that stuff from the cobar. That'll be out. So you selected a step one screen. Yes, step one screen.OK, so let's see two. And as I was mentioning, if for some reason they have an e-mail that's they would prefer it to go to, you can manually type an e-mail. The CC is production assistant and loan processor.Um, subject is. If there is a subject property, it's um, the street address. I thought we were omitting the city and state. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, that's probably too granular a detail, but OK, yeah, um.If there's no subject property, then there's a a default text documents for your loan and I believe loan number or something. But if we do have a subject property, we include part of the subject property address within the subject.Um. You have all your formatting tools. Um.And then the e-mail signature. Sorry, that's what this e-mail signature.Is that wired up? Like how do you, how are you connecting to Outlook? It's not right now. That's place over a little bit. OK, but we did talk through at least when we were doing architectural reviews. Greg did Winkler did some investigation and said that it would be possible.To use in Outlook to like an like a draft API. Yeah, OK, yeah, but it's me just.Just send emails to us. Yeah, sorry, I mean, sorry, what? But the internaler has multiple templates. I don't know how to do that for the for the signature. Yeah, I I don't know. It was some investigation. Worst case, we can just.We can allow you to import a signature, yeah, and then you can edit that and save it, and that could just be your instance for this tool or something. What are we? What are we doing for borrower uses? We're actually opening Outlook, yeah, directly. We're sending it to their e-mail address.Right. But in phase two, there's no SIG. So it's gonna be Marketing Hub if they have it set up. Oh, then then that's even easier. And then this, yeah, this is. And we have this super interesting. Do we have the AI button?Yes. Did we add that? Where's that at? It's right there.Those are the templates. But then click a new tab, then you AI buy it like there was a spot where you could you could. Yeah, you you click on that. If you click on that right next to that plus new intro with AI, then you get a modal window. You can select the tone.Oh, there it is. You only get on the new one. You don't get it after you. You can't change it after it's generated, right? There's no region. So you can create up to. I don't know if we care about limits anymore. Back then we were worried about setting limits, right? You were saying, oh, you can only do 5 versions.So what? What I'm saying is you can't change it. You created a tab formal and now you want to go calendar. You have to create a new tab, right? Yeah, you create a new tab. Yeah. Is that the best? Sure, that's what's the shot.
Shailendra Sharma   8:38Wait for this.Hey so that create new version is there's some way for them to save it?
Leslie Chang   8:45Sorry, say that again for the create new version. Is there a way to save it? I think was the question. Well, if they want to save it as a template, they they could save it as a template for sure. We have the manage templates button that allows you to do that.
Shailendra Sharma   8:47No, you.Yeah, Yep.So should it not be in the manage template section? Because that UI is not even giving them an option to actually save it in the map templates. See that new intro with AI. If we start with that, how do we actually get the item into the template?
Leslie Chang   9:11Yeah.If you.Well, you have. You would copy and paste whatever verbiage from the e-mail body you want to put into the template.
Shailendra Sharma   9:24OK.
Leslie Chang   9:25So it helps me to do it. Can I recommend from product? Can we assuming tokens are not a concern? Can we potentially allow changing the tone and the other features and doing just a regeneration? Yeah, that way there's.It's easier. I think that's more intuitive, like change the tone to like from casual to formal and then and then when you hit save, it'll regen the message. Would that be an appropriate thing? Yeah, we we did it this way because we're really trying to put a cap like, hey, you can do it five times and we didn't want them to lose.Prior versions in case there's something they got it like from the prior versions because there was a cap. But if there's no cap probably, yeah, I don't know why you're saying a cap on the instances of it until somebody sits there clicking 300 times. No, he's saying just the template saying cap, not the not the tokens.A cap on the number of times you can generate a e-mail, which is we were going to say it was five times. We said it was five times back then because we're concerned about cost and it's AI involved, right? Yeah, I don't think this with open router. I'm not, I don't, I'm not as concerned about the cost. It would cost us more to have a loan officer retype.At all, then it would for them to press a button for a fraction of a cent. So I would prefer to eat that cost and have have the the unlimited region. Yep. Yep. So that would be my recommendation. Yeah, no, I think that. I think we can.I can think what might be cool actually is you click on you know you almost treat it like a feed. You regen and print it out. You see it. If you click regen again, you'll just get a new version below that. So you could go back, scroll up, copy any version that was generated.Sure. And paste it in there. So is this, is this actually like I this is the prototype, right? Is this actually hitting an LLM for no generation? I mean, I could do that, but no, no. Yeah, for the prototype, it's not necessary. Yeah. Yeah. So it this goes up to five, Tim.I believe. I don't know if I put a cap in the prototype. OK, so I yeah, you did. But the user really well, it's overload information overload. So I have more than five tabs for user. I think even how I think to Mark's point, I think even having tabs is gonna be more than there's gonna use. I I don't think so.If I come back here later, I don't know which one was sent. Like I only care about like, well, you lose it after you sent it. It's only the one that you use that we I see saved. Like if you don't remember if you sent one, does it tell you you sent one? No. Wait the second you click send, this closes and you don't send and then you can see the one that you sent admission.Let let's make this a let's make this a Lauren to guide us like let's get her feedback on like what would be the like. We want the features, but is it overkill to have the tabs? I see your point. I don't think we need the tabs. I would say OK, then let's kill the tabs. Let's kill the tabs. OK, kill the tabs.Or killing the job. Yeah, OK, it was a it was a challenge back then to try and figure out a way to make it intuitive because you have this, this, this is important. This is your your history of the emails that were sent, right? Yep.Yeah. So after you send your e-mail, it would show up in your in the doc request history tab and to get back to the conditions portal, you would just click on the conditions portal and then you just since we're here, you have a tab for loan history.So you can see when the loan was underwriting received, file received, disclosed and also pricing information. I'm not sure if that's.Oh, sorry, that that. And they were just gonna wire it to that screen. OK. And points is very important in that context. OK, I thought I heard that they were getting rid of it, but I'm sure that I think it's clear. Yeah, OK, OK. And no, no, the loan history. So when it moves to certain status, it'll tell you what.Change data wise.
Shailendra Sharma   13:32Hey, is there a place for auto reminders because we have that in BNL phase two?
Leslie Chang   13:37Oh, we need. That's not. Yeah, we need to add that to this send e-mail and then that's good to call out. Shy to remind the borrower to get auto notification. Oh, we need this stuff from you. OK, so if you wait three days, you get another days depending on what you want to set it to and how many.
Shailendra Sharma   13:38Um.Yeah.
Leslie Chang   13:57Sometimes you want to do that. Got it. Can we do that? Are we thinking, Tim, is that going to be a a global for the for everything? So we have multiple things going right now that the emails integrated into we have.
Shailendra Sharma   13:58Yeah, yeah.
Leslie Chang   14:14So we have conditions portal, we have the needs list where they're doing the work and then we have tasks. So right now that Cathy's Yep, Yep. So are we gonna, are we gonna inherit from one of those or are we gonna? I'd like to not have its own set of brains. Yeah, that's the idea is that.There's one e-mail screen for all three of those experiences with auto reminders controlling any either task or doc requests. It's all like one e-mail and is is the docs already though it is. It's in clear docs already. It is, but it's being built for.Need the needs list as well. That same screen is being built for the needs list. We're we're using the user settings that is in the docs. So there's only one version. Yeah. OK, so we're using the the the actual data that's we're using it while we're recoding it.But the data isn't clear docs. Yes, the user has 11 settings. One settings. Yeah, that's. Yeah, I agree with you. So does that mean that if I'm John the processor, what if I say I want a three day reminder that applies to all of my borrowers?Is that my forward until I change? Yes. So I will not say for loan #22, I want to make it two days. I can change it on a per instance basis, but my default's full in. OK, so I have a default but I can override on a month basis. OK here.
Shailendra Sharma   15:36Hey, can you go back to the signature piece? You know how difficult it is for people to just copy their signature from the Outlook and stick it in there and use it like the template that we have so.
Leslie Chang   15:49Some loan officers in multiple templates in Outlook. It's easy, but they don't like to have to do that extra step.
Shailendra Sharma   15:53Yeah.OK, yeah, that.
Leslie Chang   15:57Both for the loan offers since I use marketing hub, that's what they it just shows. Would it do you do you have any experience with this? Would it be possible with Outlook to to pull all the e-mail signatures and present them a list so they can just select?
Shailendra Sharma   16:08No, I I don't think it will be possible with. Yeah, I I don't think it will be possible with Outlook unless we have a central depository to pull it from. I have not explored that, so I don't know. But I was thinking, you know, let's say they have how many can they have like 3 or 4?If they were to, you know, copy paste from Outlook into template, you know our intro template kind of user interface, then they can pick it right here.
Leslie Chang   16:38So essentially it defines six SIG tablets. That's kind of that was kind of my idea is like just maybe let you import if you want, but you just we own your own local signatures and if you want more than one, you can choose which one.
Shailendra Sharma   16:38Like.Yeah, yeah, fixed. Yeah.Yeah, yeah, yeah.Yeah, that way, even if the Outlook does not work, you know all they have to do is one time they have to copy paste from Outlook into here and then it is here forever.And they can modify it here also. Nothing is stopping them from saying, hey, you know, I copied it two days ago from Outlook and I want to change something. Go ahead and change it.
Leslie Chang   17:05Sure.But these it's gonna get overwritten if you've you've had it set up in marketing if it's added. So don't have to know. Well, I think that'd be an import often. Like let them do it. Let them choose to do it. Yeah, my my recommendation would be have an import, have a have an app, have a a.A user click import option from Marketing Hub or Outlook, whatever we have to check for and then that'll bring it in and then internally you can you can have multiple versions of a of a signature and and you choose your default and then maybe within the tool if you want to pick a different.
Shailendra Sharma   17:41Yeah.
Leslie Chang   17:47Signature for this particular instance you can you can change it from the you choose it from the drop down. So there's just an import button that can run at any time or you can just do it. Yeah, whatever like yeah yeah or just an edit tool. I think I think the import's overkill for this one.So page one, we just allow them to copy and paste, give an HTML editor, let them three. OK, so let me make this 5 signatures and let them choose a default or one of the options in the e-mail is let them choose a different signature. So I want to use like my.My partner, my corporate signature. I I choose that in the drop down and then you just re render the signature in the in the HTML.
Shailendra Sharma   18:29Yeah.
Leslie Chang   18:29Yeah, that was basically like what Outlook has to say. Yeah, more or less, yeah.OK, so we went over doc doc request history, loan history, and then there's also going to be a tab for clear docs.OK, let's go back to Tim's. So this tab's gonna be a problem if they're doing it by which which tab? What's up? They have to go to like. Oh, we just got to open it at the No, we're gonna keep it all in the same browser. It's a tab within the window tab. What's that? Didn't want it side by side.They can still open up clear docs separate. We could do that. Well, clear docs. You can always, oh, which is accessible. Oh, the back window is an external process. An external process. They wanna do that. Yeah.OK, but they just want quick access from bite without having to do that. They still have that option. It's it's nice to have a quick docs view.So that's for bar conditions and then we have our internal conditions. So to request, so when a processor makes a request for an internal condition like an appraisal report or a title.Commitment, then they would mark it as requested. Can I make a recommendation here? Yeah, the product folks, when we do that, should we allow again, since we have cloud code, I'm trying to be a little more ambitious. Could we have it pop a window?That that tries to generate an e-mail that they could then type in the the vendor name and request like Toni, how did how did they do that from the party screen we would just take the vendor actually well I think we could cause.Clear docs today. It now supports sending emails to external vendors. So we should just extend that here. Same same thing. You select the external vendor result, right? Yeah, they have party screen does have third party. So maybe maybe have like all the vendors in the drop down.And you can choose one or you could just say blank e-mail and then they could just type if it's all. The reason I'm suggesting it is because I want to take advantage of our e-mail history because that way I would then know that they sent an e-mail to a vendor and it's it's tracked if they have. If we send them to Outlook, we lose the visibility, right? It's a central location for all of the.And so it is the vendor information and party screen generally accurate, would you say? If it's kind of like the car next thing, they can type it differently from other like if you have first Americans, yeah, you have first American.Title Company Inc and then one could just be First American. So I can go ahead and clear right now and see how that OK, just something I guess I thought, yeah.So we want to have by the way start sending Bing. Yeah like either auto complete with an existing vendor or a blank e-mail that you can and then if if if it if it's possible AI or not to to have a little request message.Cause we know, we know everything. We know the loan, we know the borrower, we know what doc we're asking for. So we might as well Gen. a a a request and and try to just put something in the body. You know what I mean?And so let's assume that processor has made a bunch of requests for internal conditions. You can hit this button, which is a select all for everything within that stage, and then do a mass update for condition status. Let's say you've requested all of those.Conditions from your external vendors, you can just then mark it requested and then it's going to do a mass update and change the status for all of those loan conditions that you selected. So there's multiple things that you can do. You can suspend, remove. If you want to do flags for multiple conditions, you can do that.As well, you can toggle it off by clicking on that respective condition as well if you didn't want to do a mass update and then our our flags one to one, not one to many, right?Yeah, one can't have a blue and a red.Oh, flags and usual. Oh, I did not. Oh, meaning. Meaning what? Meaning that an underwriter won't see processor's flags? Yeah, it's blue for me, but red for him.I develop that. I don't think anybody there. We had a lot of discussion around this. The sole purpose of place today is for them to communicate back and forth around some kind of note that's on the line, but if it's but if it's not switch to tags, but if more important if it's.Personal, then it's not communicative. It's just self-management. It's meant. Yeah, it's meant to help them self-manage because those are the new communication tool.That's my recommendation. Let's have Lauren. That's a that's a great Lauren clarification. I would let's get her to I I would ask two questions. One are flags. Do we agree that flags are user specific individual?#2 should and this is a question for you guys. Should we have more than one flag? Like let's say a green flag means it's it's a rush and an orange flag means it's got like a trouble borrower. I don't know like is there value in having more than one flag to?Represent multiple states of vote. But I think what you said to me some time ago was the flags are a red may mean something bad. Yeah, for me to just stop in here, right. I don't. Again, that's the other question. That's the other thing we weren't going to have. Yeah, there's no, there's there was no standard definition. That's the problem today. There's no.Standard definitions. It's just a red, blue-green. I like how it's like text red already. Yeah, yeah, even. So that's why we put in the we'll pull it up real quick. Leslie volume actually. OK, just I think anyways. But it says these flags are your personal flags and will not be visible to others accessible. Where does that say that Tim if you click on the flag?Oh, these flags are your personal flags and will not be it's personal. We don't. We should not be constrained by by using colors. We can just use tags. I got my tags, you got your tags. No, the tags mean a lot more. Yeah, I mean the rest of the.We even debated getting rip flags. Um, yeah, but I yeah, I I don't think.The challenge if I and I think the challenge if we go to people and ask them about flag space, it means different things to different people in their existing world. So it'll be hard for them to imagine a new world where they have this high level of transparency. So let's let's ask Lauren and tell her to.This is what we have. Either you agree with it or go to your research and come back and tell us otherwise. I think it's it's it's free to change it now. I I just hate to have something like this not be like we get to production and and now it's like a thing. Yeah.Anyway, all good.
Shailendra Sharma   25:54Hey so so how how do how do we filter by flags? I mean I I can put in you know green flag, red flag. Do we have a filter by flag?
Leslie Chang   26:04Yeah, so there's a filter for all of the conditions. You can do it by category. Like if I would just want to do my app or my credit and then bar internal, external, you can sort by flags. This is my prototype. I didn't.I don't think I realized we had color, so I just put flagged, unflagged and then you can do by status doc requests with or without. You can also sort ascending, descending by various categories.
Shailendra Sharma   26:19Yeah.OK, so Josephine, if we go with tags, then that would have to be multiple tags there.
Leslie Chang   26:40The only reason I sent tags is because people always want to get home. They don't want to. Well, I agree you. You're compelling arguments is if it's persist, then why does it need to be constrained? Because who cares what they write? Yes, but if it's public, then then then we need some sort of organization.
Shailendra Sharma   26:41And that.Yeah, yeah.
Leslie Chang   26:58I I think, I I think we did talk about doing tags. We're just concerned about stoke. But I imagine with there isn't a slot with the scope. The engineer's talking.Flags today and clear. People want to add flags that are gonna be universal for everybody. We have to put a kibosh on just saying I want this flag up or this tag, this tag, this tag because it can get out of control. So I think we have this. Let's go with what we have and have Lauren type it if she wants to change it. Is that?A fair, fair direction. Well, because it's personal, I don't want to be constrained by the byte data. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Yep. Chai has a question. Yeah, go ahead, Shi.
Shailendra Sharma   27:35Hey, one more question on the.Hey, another question on the doc request.Yeah, hey, on the doc request, is it the open doc request or the ones that we already received?
Leslie Chang   27:52The doc request is the one that you it's outbound. You're requesting it for the borrower. You had not received a document yet.
Shailendra Sharma   27:57OK. And once you receive it, then it basically goes away from here, correct?
Leslie Chang   28:01Then the document press gets status to complete and it disappears. Yeah, well, then you have to go through the then you have to go through the document workflow, the acceptance process, which is new documents workflow, right?
Shailendra Sharma   28:05Yeah.Yeah, OK.
Leslie Chang   28:16And search really quick. I don't think I went over this, but you can basically um search by your ID number or like a a keyword.Or you could use the the filter that I just showed.It's searched by ID and I think I have seven fields listed for searching somewhere. I think we went over everything in the header. Need to request requested active.This are we using the this?Yeah. Are we using export? What? What does it do? It exports the conditions. I don't see an issue with that. This is you can browse.People would like they're comfortable in Excel. Yeah. Or they want to put that into their own letter. They export it out and then they copy and paste it, send an e-mail to the borrower. I made this, which is, I mean, which I've seen people together. I would argue it's probably OK. It's it's not.It's not. They're not exporting their pipeline, right? I was gonna say. I always get I I I think that's valuable because people like to do cool stuff with it. But you know, I always get shot down like, no, they're gonna steal your lead, their leads. I'm like, yeah, it's their own leads anyways, and they're in Surefire.Leslie, what else do we have? Oh, yeah, sorry. That's OK. So I think I'm a little lost. Tim, maybe you can help me. So the next step would be clean up and accept reject docs. Is there where? Where do I go for that? Clean up. Oh, so what I would do here is.Do I need to change? Go to just grab the list of documents that I sent you. You will bulk upload of those documents on the same one because there's no like state change here. It's we're just waiting for the borrowers and stuff. So this will show what it what a grab these.That's scrap.People can and then just drag it or drag it to the.To load from your computer.And that way she saved up.That is.One more hit. Click on the text. Yeah, there you go.That's it.Oh, I think you want to put that in the top bar. Oh, yeah, sorry. Is that a feature or a? Sorry about that.Very good. Oh, I'm sure. Oh, OK.Oh, OK, one at a time. Maybe it was you. Maybe you have some weird file types like web cannot open multiple items from this location. It's only letting me do one. So that that must be a that must be a just a prototype prototype limitation. I I thought I.Maybe it was I using my prototype? Oh, here we go. Maybe I was using the wrong prototype.And I should be able to drag and drop into that window.Oh, yeah, OK.Now I can drag and drop it. Yeah, you should be able to drag and drop multiple into that window because you have the target area, right?Yeah, I think your selector is only allowing single select. Oh, because this is your select window. Yeah, and it's it's not letting you do. Okay.But if you drop, I bet you if you drag and drop, it'll let you.There we go.So the goal what was what's this use case where where the where the I'm just trying the processor up adding the docs that were like emailed to us.This is reviewing and accepting OK documents. Yeah, sure. Which? Here, let me let me just which one? Which file are you on? Sorry, which file? Yeah, which one?It worked.Yeah, it works on. It does. Maybe it's.Is it working on your machine? Yeah, I just uploaded. See. Do you wanna refresh? Oh, OK.There we go. Gravy dots.There we go. You just loaded them all now. Yeah. Oh, nice. OK.All right. So not assigned to condition. We can click. Yeah, you can. So important thing to call out here is that. So there's three ways borrowers can upload they can.Or the the borrower can send documents back. They can upload directly to the document request within the home portal, which is a consumer facing application. They can upload to the miscellaneous bucket on the home portal which doesn't assign it to any kind of condition.Or they can send it via e-mail. It's not assigned to a condition will show essentially anything that was borrow or uploaded that that was not assigned to a condition, so they just uploaded that miscellaneous bucket.That way, if somebody comes in here, they're not missing out on any documents that weren't assigned anything, but were provided by the file.And it's asking them to do something about it. So then they would come in here, they'd look at the document, they'd sign it out to a condition and accept or reject it.This is very similar to our earlier demo, right? Yeah, same use case. This is the same use case. I mean, if we want to, you can annotate all that, you can annotate all that good stuff. If you want to show more of the wizard flow, yeah, how do we get to the wizard flow?We can probably skip ahead of the writer, which I I'll already be struck with that scenario. Jump to the underwriter. Yes, jump to the.A conditions for review loan. Oh, OK, there we go. And then this would be the underwriter perspective of the workflow.Hey and is this screen here? Is this a clear docs screen or is this a conditions portal screen? Conditions portal screen. You would have to build it into a conditions portal screen so they can do it all within the same OK window. So this is allowing them the underwriter to review each condition and the.Document so they can mark it as suspend, not cleared or cleared, add their notes and accept the document and you and does the reject work as well? So then.If you want to reject a document, then you can add a note to the condition or the document description here.Was there a concept of partial? Except like I got 3 pages. I like page one and two, but I don't like page three. Is that a thing? Yeah, so.They can. They can modify the document, accept, but still created in doc request. OK, so you we're accepting this, but I still need something else. I still need something else. They could mark the the.They they could set the status of the condition to be whatever they want to fit that. Got it. OK, they can say, hey, it's not ready. I accept this document, but you're still missing. OK, still missing. And that that's that that use case exists here.Yeah, in order. There's not like a direct path for them. OK, it's just so they're just independent. Yeah. So essentially what they to do, what you're talking about, they'd come in here, they'd see it. They would be able to delete pages from here, right? Oh, I I want to delete this page doesn't work. I'll keep these two pages.I accept this document, I mark it as not ready. I close this window, I go out and I add a doc request for got it the following and then later if I get that new doc I could merge it with the current doc, the one that I saved and that becomes my attached doc type.Yes, yeah, because you can see the accepted document in there and I could just, I could pick them and then I can mix and match. OK, merge. Yep. OK, trying to think what else have I missed here?Processor reviews disposition is.What's disposition associated conditions? I don't think I know what that is. They've marked them as cleared or I mean or they've marked them as ready for underwriting. OK, update that as can identify docs to be reviewed.True.Yep.And I think, I think that's, I think that's everything. Show them what is.Looks like you can like like the check box next for suspended condition. Check box and see the suspend button on the right. Suspended condition. Yeah, so there's. Oh no, you're right there. close that. close that the bulk select. See it's in the red button. Oh, OK.Should this would it bubbles it to the top? Yep, always. OK, gives it the red. Yeah. Oh, OK.Oh, it's not. It's only 100. No, it's there. It just looks purple in the.I think Tony that it's not red unless you right. Let's recover over it. They're lying. The road didn't. I thought I was blind it. It's not. It's not. I think it should. It's not clear that it's suspended. Yeah, it's kind of pink on my laptop. It's not showing. Yeah, it's a little. You can see it on. It's not very strong, but it's actually pink.If you're on the screen, yeah, the projector, yeah.Anything else that I missed from the prototype? I think that's everything trying to think. Um, I'd love for.I think the first questions from you guys from engineering.I think I'm good.Yeah, Josephine, can we do a? I'd like to look at this from a different angle. I'd like to have you show. Let's Let's go a level.Uh, the Legos for what we wanna do. I'll go to the thing.Uh, looks like the switch. Um.Oh, did we lose them? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, no. I think Josephine's still on. Are you on the teams? Do we still have Shailendra? Oh, she's. He's still here. He's still here. Hi, Shailendra. I'm looking for my mouse.
   40:55Yes, I'm here.
Shailendra Sharma   41:01Hey, Mark.
Leslie Chang   41:01Hey, you're you're a little bit quiet for us. Sorry because you're on this laptop. Was there anything else, any questions before we moved on? We're going to move away from the demo and we're we're Josephine's going to talk about the data model and like just implications around roles, permissions and that kind of thing. Did you have any?
Shailendra Sharma   41:19Yep. No, no. I think, you know, I have gone through this multiple times and I think this looks nice. You know the, you know what we have built here should be very helpful.
Leslie Chang   41:27Awesome.Thank you to Tim and Leslie for the involvement. That's a lot of work, so appreciate it.
Shailendra Sharma   41:40Yep. Yep. Great job, guys.
Leslie Chang   41:42So I I think that one of the takeaways will be we'll we'll we'll take all of our notes and then whatever other feedback and we'll sort of let's Polish the design and and and then that'll be what we provide along with all of our.Good requirements. We talk about more. Yep. Um.Yeah.Yes, we had a couple of parking lots. The architecture. Oh, Leslie, can you go through to Kelly? Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.The cardinal roles, yeah, I wanted to do that with Kelly. But should we have these groups understand that that feeds into the other questions?Can we do it with Kelly just so we don't have to do it twice? See if she's I'm gonna see. Yeah. Are you pinging her, Mark? Yeah. OK. Uh, she's presenting.Should call it. Hey Kelly, I was wondering if you could be available in the next two hours for half an hour to talk through some conditions portal stuff with the team.When I text you guys, this is exactly how I do it. I kinda guessed. How's he so fast but also so inaccurate? This This is why it's exactly what we're Why don't we go? Why don't we start with like where we have and then and then we will. I'd prefer Kelly to help us with the cardinal little stuff.And I think that was your your ask, 'cause there was like a black screen with like 5 items. Yeah, I think that's where we left off right before lunch. Amanda, did the audio on my teams.Oh, are you? Are you? Is your can I do the audio on my teams? Sorry, yeah, turn on the audio.
Carlos Sanchez   43:46Yeah, we can barely hear Josephine, so it would be helpful to.
Josephine Yen   43:50Here, let's let's mute Carlos here.
Carlos Sanchez   43:51Yeah, that's better.
Josephine Yen   44:00Carlos. Oh, you're back. Carlos. Sorry. All right.Shoot. OK, I was making a change, so hopefully I didn't break anything. OK, OK, OK, so I have um.I have three samples, I have a get condition list and I also have the schema for that. I don't need to get conditions and I'll tell you why, but I told Claude to rename it but.He didn't, he just added the next one. But I have something else called get loan conditions. So the get loan conditions is that landing screen that you've been seeing when Tim and Leslie are presenting. It's like all year loan conditions. This is when you're adding a condition.So we're gonna go look at the get loan conditions sample.So I kept it very skinny. You've got the file data ID, which is the loan number. You've got a conditions, which is an array of conditions. I only have two IDs. I have a condition ID and then I have a document ID, so I'll get to that in just a second.You've got the condition category. What you see in the UI is something that looks very nice and tidy. You've got app 100 that actually represents 2 fields. One's called category, the other one's called number. Condition name. Sorry, let me restate. Condition ID exists in byte, condition category exists in byte, condition number exists.In byte condition name does not exist in byte. That's something that we're going to have to add. So we need to figure out when we add a condition, what do we do with data that do not exist in byte condition description that exists in byte. That's the full text.Yeah, when you there's a are are we pulling from byte here or is this like from our own? So those are all, those are all discussions we need. I don't have the answer, but those are things that we have to talk about. We were talking about potentially having our vote.
Shailendra Sharma   46:02Yeah.
Josephine Yen   46:02Yes, yes. So and after a new, a new, yes, that's what I call, that's what we called it the the Kelly Cardinal rules. We coined that. Yeah, OK, condition description type that is a field that exists in byte, but I don't see it in the byte API.
Shailendra Sharma   46:04Hey Josephine, would it be? Would it make sense?Hey, Josephine.
Josephine Yen   46:22But essentially Byte has something that's out-of-the-box that says when the condition is defined, it's defined when you set it up as a template, editable or not editable. The third option is custom question. CMG doesn't use custom question, but they will be using custom question, but editable just means.Across the board, no one can edit a description. Across the board, everyone can edit a description and then permissions is another layer on top with every field that says who can do what when, OK.How come it's?Dark. OK. And then condition stage is the PTD that you saw those headers, those groupings. Condition provider is that IN. So they don't, they didn't update my sample. It's the INT and BWR. So that one has. So I have a schema for this.INT means it's internal, BWR means it's borrower, and they're going to be using one which is blank, and that's Kelly. Class is underwriter of processor 3 as far as we're concerned. Responsibility is probably going to be blank.And I just added this, so ignore this. It didn't put it where I wanted it, so ignore that. Josephine question, do you you built this with clock? Yeah. Do you plan all the verbal you're going over to kind of provide a maybe a field description?Yes, it's in schema. OK, so so everything you're saying is is also documented. Yeah, there's schema. I have a separate file. OK, OK, just making sure. Yes, I have a separate file that's a schema. Then we've got the follow up date, the condition expiration date and Tim was talking about how we're going to automate that from the documents.We have to have a breakout call with the business on the exception request workflow. I don't have the details, but these are three data types that I could see inside a byte, which is the requested date and time, who it was done by, and then somebody sending a status on it.In the Figma you'll see that we want to know like who is the person that last made changes to the condition. So I added modify date and time and modify by condition statuses is also an array and it contains a date and timestamp.Who it's by and the condition status condition notes. So you'll see that a condition has one to many condition statuses and a condition has one to many notes. So this is the array of notes.Then it's got document requests, so one to many document requests. There's a document request status who it's for. What I did here is I used an enum. I didn't specify that app one is.Is Rusty's and Rusty wife, right? I didn't specify that and I don't have the B1. I don't specify that it's Rusty Burns. The CB1, I don't specify that that's Leslie Chang. So there's going to be some look up to the IRLA, so I didn't put it in the model.OK, and then you've got the document type. So this is the same document type that is actually in byte store docs. It's also replicated, duplicated in clear docs. So that's really the the, the, the.The Gemini process that you're talking about, document description borrower is the borrower friendly description that we have for the document and that one, I don't know if that exists today. Is that in that spreadsheet that we got from Pema? It should be OK, so then but that that is not.That is a very technical description. It's not the description that we want to use for our borrowers. I think AI will take this and morph that into a dynamically friendly. So meaning we may not have to. I would reengineer templates to start with, but that way the AI doesn't get too crazy. But.I think it'll certainly get regen when we create that e-mail. OK, Shai did put a question in the chat. Oh, you did regarding what you were saying is in by, is in by, isn't by. If if it starts with AB, it's coming for by kind of indicate on model property where it's coming from.We're gonna have to go through this again, 'cause I I asked some a similar question. Yeah, right. It's like, where is this coming from? Where is it going? Yeah. And and the reason I we have to figure that out. Yeah. And the reason. So this is where we we have to have the Kelly Cardinal discussion because.She's concerned not just about underwriting and processing, she's concerned about the full conditional workflow for the life of the loan post closing and post funding. So the the comment that we make that makes her nervous, which is once it's the condition portal loan then.That's that's not going to work for her and everybody else. So I came up with a Brainiac suggestion. So would let's just wait for the Kelly call and we can talk about it.But yeah, this is, this is it. I think it needs to be still a work in progress. Yes. And it's what it's so we're getting a look at like a slice of Josephine's brain as she's working through. Yeah. So in my mind, the condition portal is a standalone. When Mark said it's a standalone app, it is a standalone app. And then.We sync to Byte what Byte can support and then the only problem I have is Byte has autosave turned on. If we sync alone from our condition portal whole database and we sync whatever the data that it can support to Byte and somebody in Byte can go.To that screen and muck around with notes, it's gonna muck us up on the condition portal side. So we need to figure out. So that's I would, but apparently according to yeah, but we can't change that out-of-the-box object and bite. We're stuck with it according to Kelly.She can't lock one person out, some people out in certain points in time. They're locking everybody out.So I mean, my my brainiac thought was that if somebody were to touch it, we just recover. We roll back Mark's time machine, we roll back to the last date. So we never lost anything. That was my brainiac idea. But I mean, we we have.I I just want to systems that have, yeah, data that needs to get updated from byte. Yeah, and it's like what's our what's our time scale? Are we OK with like if somebody updates something related to a condition, can we accept like a a 32nd delay for it to show up in conditions portal?And then if they were to go in and mock up our date, our condition port alone because it's got less data and do a save, save over that, I don't want to lose that data. So I want to recover that, bring that data back. They they had no business touching that condition anyways, but we can't stop them from touching it.So you literally, you literally don't want to accept their change. You want to say your change is wrong. Condition portal is the source of truth. Yes, and if you want to change it, you have to go to condition portal to change it because otherwise we're going to lose all of our notes data. We're going to lose all of our document relationships. We're going to lose a lot of things.Or we say that whatever it is that you touch on that side, you don't touch this. So that gets that gets that gets complicated. It's like I own this data, but we share you own. We share this data. Let's use Lauren as our pitfall for that to help say this is our this is a technical constraint.Right. And this is how we want to how the behavior needs to be. Once you're in the conditions portal, that's it. You don't go back. You know what I mean? So if we're wanting people to use the conditions portal, right, and only use the conditions portal and we're putting an invite, why don't we lock down those fields? Well, if they're if they're never going to change them and if they so we're talking about two stakeholders.How many stakeholders? There's QAQC, right? And then there's like post funding and I don't know, post funding and post funding and post closing. Are they the same? I don't know that post funding is it's.Post closing the same as post funding here. They're two different things. OK, so that's like 7 to 10, seven to 10 different departments there. So you if you want to roll out conditions portal, you've got processing, underwriting and this seven to 10 other departments. So how do we?We roll this out without disturbing the seven to 10 other departments who actually have to touch the loan. They have to look at these conditions. They have to change the conditions in byte and they're going to be using conditions in byte. Yes, and they are using conditions in byte. So my thought was.Instead of saying it's a low level flag like Trid was is that it is not a low level flag. It's if you ever want to touch one of our condition portal conditions, accidentally you touch it in byte, we roll it back to our data so we never lose it.Or we only rollback the things that are going to get damaged by you trying to save. Or we don't sync anything from you from byte to our condition portal database because we're going to be a whole piece of data. You can't touch it. We'll sync back what you can actually send us, but we don't sync back notes. We own notes.I think, I think there's a there's a lot of things we have to. I think there's so much flex there. We can, I mean.We can lock down conditions. You can't lock in and bite. You can't. Kelly already told us you can't. But I mean the the Speaking of TRID. Yeah, I know. That's what I'm saying. Like this. God for you. It's OK. No, no, go ahead. Oh, and I even heard me say this before going from the good faith estimate.Estimate route or the loan estimate route. Yes, Trid came about. Yes, Biden. It came out by Biden said you go one path or the other because you can't commingle. You will be out of compliance because they're so different, right? So it's kind of the same thing. If you ran a good faith estimate on a loan, you've got to restart. So there's a way to keep them.At least as far as trade was concerned from doing you either you're on this path, you stick with this path. The problem is you can't. What do we do with the other 7 to 10 departments that need to use conditions without hurting our conditions? How do we roll this out so that so this is the Kelly meeting. How do we roll this out?So that we can still get the efficiencies and the learnings from our condition portal and not disrupt the seven to 10 other departments that need to work conditions on the loan.So, so everybody wins.That's the question. OK, so now you've got documents. So I only have condition ID and document ID, and then you got the document for who it's for. I don't specify that it's, you know, Rusty Burns or Leslie Chang, so you have to do a look up to IRLA. The document type is the same thing. The document name is the same thing.Document description is in. The other document description is the borrower version. This is the byte store docs version, the document expiration date, who was modified last if we were to do that burn on save and the date and time and document statuses is also an array, so you've got the actual.Status itself, who did it and the date and time question documents model doesn't change for conditions portal. It's it's identical to clear docs. Is that true? I don't think there's. I don't think they have the document expiration.And um.And notes too. So there's document. I think there's document notes and document expiration. They have it clear docs. I thought we did. I thought. I thought it was in there. I don't recall that being a change. I do recall I I looked at to add a new document status.I think so I haven't. I haven't reconciled it. I don't remember that one. I only did. I believe it could be doc should be 95% intact. If yes, there's a few extra fields, but I but ideally we're gonna inherit what's already there. Yes, document expires is part of the current.Yeah, yes, OK. And then the is the document status 1 field in clear docs or is it an array? Is it an array?Yeah, I don't know if it's an array, meaning it can be more than one or meaning it's a it's a history, meaning it's a history.Obviously you have a history of the doc types. I need to fix this. Yeah, I don't know. You might have to. You might have to go. You might have to go. Yeah. And then document notes. Is document notes in clear docs, right, Tim or Gina? I mean, yeah, it is. OK, so document notes session.And change. And then that's the next document, next document. And then are we trying to show them a history? Why do we need the history of documents? Oh yeah, the no statuses of the document. Oh, why would we need that? We have, we have when it was created.In our UI, we have last modified the status itself, because I was wondering, we don't have the status, but we have last modified. OK, hopefully they have. But I mean, I think you want to build the audit trail, whether you show it or not, you still need to have it. And also that goes to how many touches.They keep sending junk. Yeah. And if you want to, yeah. So I think what Mark was talking about. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And documents are the key components of what's happening. Yep, so. But I have a schema if you want to look at the schema.But so my my point is that I think they have an audit log in docs. Oh pretty sure that hopefully we can just clear that like expecting an array of.So successful? Yeah, I haven't looked at the docs API.Mhm.File data ID conditions is an array. I only have required file data ID and conditions definitions.Condition ID, condition category. So these are the categories that we currently have in bite. You notice that standard is not in here, so I need to add standard. But standard is a list that somebody made that is based on all of these condition number.Um.It's 3 to 4 digits as far as I could tell. Condition name, something new we're adding. Condition description, condition description type, which is whether it's editable or not editable in custom question, the different stages.Condition provider. That was an enum. It didn't update. OK, that was supposed to be an enum class. There's a going to be a bunch of them, but the ones that we only care about are the two responsibility. I left that as TBD because I think there's some changes on the bite site.And that's the one. Jina's freaking out. Yes. So which one? Responsibility. Yeah, all of her work is tied to your follow up date condition expiration date. So the whole exception one is going to be a breakout. I don't have that information yet. Modify by.Verify date and time. Condition status is to have it as an array. Condition notes is an array. Document requests is an array. Documents is an array. These are the required fields. Condition status. These are the enums.Mission note, I have the three fields under note. Those are required document requests, the status. Those are the enums document four. I made it be dynamic based on the app document type. I didn't load it yet. I just got the list from Hema yesterday.Those 3 fields are required. Document, document ID, document force, same thing, document type, just at that list from Hema, document name from Hema, document description from Hema and document expiration date.So it'd be step by user as far as I know, modify by date and time when they do the burn on save document statuses is I had it as an array but we can change that and these are the enums for the document statuses.And then document notes no different than condition notes. Candy says hello and and it had they haven't fixed my. I have to fix the user level. I just moved to follow up flag to user level so that broke so I need to fix that.So that's the get conditions. As you can tell, the conditions UI did not have a save button.So.That means that every time you work one condition in any of the screens that you work at, if you work on the document requests, just that one portion of the condition, or you work on reviewing the document, which is that one portion of the condition.Or you are in a wizard and you're working through multiple conditions that touch whether it's a document request or a document with the condition itself. We need to save it to Byte.Yeah, the way.You click a, there's always a button on any one of those screen. There's they're not literally states. With the exception of one, there's a like a primary action on the screen. So like when you accept the document, that's when the save commit. For example, when I set the status of the condition, that's when the save would commit. So it's kind of buttons, but it's tight.But not save buttons. It's like a terminal actions, just actions. Yeah, got you. So. So we need to think about because what I gave was the get payload, not the save payload. Save payload. We need to figure out how we want to do that. Are we doing it at the?If I'm doing a document request for a condition, am I doing it? Is it a put request just for that one condition? Or am I doing the modular piece which is just the condition, the document request itself? Because.Updating the document request. It doesn't. It doesn't really move the condition any except for the fact that it's linked to the condition. Same thing with the document. The only thing that I'm doing is updating the document, but doesn't really do anything to the condition per say.So we need to talk that part through. I don't have it figured out. Posing cost worksheet today does a full of every the get of everything and then it just do a wipe and replace back. Not the best model in the world.So I don't think that's we don't want to do that. Can I can I make a recommendation and Rusty correct me here. I think product should say this is what we believe to be the data model and we want it to save on field change and let engineering decide.I don't know that we need to go much deeper than that. So that way you guys can decide what like or come back with an alternative. Is that? My fear is I don't want a deep dive architect. I don't want product to deep dive too much architecturally. I want.You guys to tell us what you recommend based on the requirements. I feel like it's a question, but I mean also Scott are experts. Yeah, either way, but I I agree with you. So there's no stay button. I wanted you to notice that. Yeah. So that's that's a big deal. Yeah. Not that you like literally everything you get that is.Slightly prescriptive. I I have told people to to take it. They, you know, suggest a very strong suggestion, right? Like we're gonna get as close as we can to to design and we have to make sure that like we're getting all of the data that we need and and saving it, right? Yeah. And then and then we need to communicate to Josephine because she wants to know.How is it actually going to behave, right? Because it's a little fuzzy. Yeah, it's like fuzzy lines. Like I think engineering should they get a little bit of say in the design and product has a little bit of say in like the call it the architecture, but but you still are on your own side of the fence. I don't, I don't want a product person to spend 3 weeks.Weeks like trying to figure out the whole CRUD model or or transaction when that's not their job and vice versa. Can I make a comment, a suggestion on your model? Is this the same one? No. Do on your other one do do what's the opinion?Of the team up at the top where you had your collections, do we want to have a collection for the history of the changes like the call it an audit or is that already being handled? There were audits pieces.But it's not like in a in in a one with within a container with is there is there value in that like like the imagine the the condition itself, whatever happens, you have a lot of data. Do we want an audit trail of what changed at a condition level or is that like overkill?Yeah, I think we do. Do we do we need it? Do we need it? We retrieve the condition or do we need it on a specific page that shows the auto history? I don't even know it needs to be shown. It could be available if we open it up in our report. So my thought was really just the status that we need. So that's why I made.The so not just every status change, but like um.So, so it's just like every time you have a status change, there's a status record. So I could, let's say there's five statuses, right? It starts one and then second, third and then went back to two. So I have another row for two and then it went to four and it went back to two again. So I can I see all the status changes, not necessarily.What else in it changed? The only reason it needs to be in the model is if we're gonna be using it in some way, right? Well, that's that's about that's the then you don't care. Then I don't care. But as long as the touches, as long as the condition ID is linked, then you can, yeah, OK, then we can run it. OK, so that's why I did. I defined the condition statuses as an array.Right because I want to have a record for every time it change. I don't care that today the the way the by model works is I see the latest for condition status one. Yeah we'll have change date change on like what? Yeah. And if we need to know what changed we we can store that. I don't I don't know if we need that. Do we do you think we need to know what?That data change to me would be you needed less cash to close and who you know who changed that. But that that's ERLA data, that's not a condition data and that's in that's in the auto locker. Yeah, but are we for the data eventually with?What pulling pulling early data was to concatenate it into the description of the condition. Not that after the fact, but whatever it is, they said I need 11,700 cash to close. Somebody went in and redid the calculation to make sure that it was 11,897. No, we're not doing that. You need if you just need to know.When it was changed and what the status was changed to. Yeah, I think that's all we need to know. You don't care about the history of the condition attached. What about the attached condition docs? Do you care about that? Like it was this it changed to? Well, I have. I have an array of condition document statuses as well.History of document status changes. OK, so you'll know for a given condition if it was assigned and assigned more than five times, that'll all be accessible. I don't have the changes on link. That's a problem. So this to me looks like the response to an API file, right? Yeah, it's a only include the things that we're gonna.Need to display or use for some logic to display, right? Yes, if you need an audit log that has specific piece of information, I I did not do that. Let's make that a Lauren to do. Leslie is we'll ask for do you want an audit at the condition level? Is that?What data do would you be auditing? Do you care that different underwriters kept on mucking around with the description? I don't know. I'm making that up. This does ties, I think also somewhat into what Kelly brought up of her by things, right? Which is.Data. We don't want to disrupt the reporting that they currently have today. So I wonder if some of that reporting is on some of the stuff that we're talking about with the history. What the intent of this is that we did measure the number of touches, for example, yes.That's why I meant for the status changes. I wanna see the touches, right?And so my my point is, it doesn't necessarily have to be part of part of the API model, right? As long as we're capturing it and servicing it where it needs to be serviced, OK, then then that's fine. OK. So that's that's one of the things that we'll be like we'll be going through and making sure that like it only has the data it needs and then other things are requirements for for other things.So what I'm missing, which I didn't realize until we got to this meeting today is and I'll tell you I have another one is I didn't do, I don't have a loan notes, all of that thing we got clarified on. So I don't have that in there. I think we agreed that that we weren't gonna have that. That was just a filter of an existing.I need to do a get to bring it to bring it in. I don't know how that works today, so I'm missing that I'm missing. I don't have documents that are not linked to a condition, so I don't know how we're going to do that and obviously I don't want to include documents.The under.Is working on like the one that Jina was talking about, the 9900, whatever. So there's some, there's a documents that should even though they're updated to byte store docs like the Smart V Cert, AUS findings. Yeah, no one has to look at those. I want to make sure that those don't come in here somehow.I didn't include that so I'm missing that and then the condition notes there's a there's a has it been read by the user or not? I didn't know how to put that into the model so I didn't put that in there. So we have two user level things, the follow up flag which I tried to do and it broke it and then the.Whether me as a user read this condition note or not.So I'm missing that. OK, the next thing that I have is I have the get condition lists. So you saw the that side by side UI that Tim and Leslie presented that has you know my custom and then you had all those things you click on it.Somebody was asking about that search. It's search all conditions. What I have here is I can have a list name of a condition that is all docs. I have a condition list name.And it's not a custom list because it's the same list that's in byte. I don't know why they put the user ID in here. I didn't ask it to, so ignore that. And then in here in here you have an array of conditions. Each condition has a condition ID. Now this is not the same condition ID that's in the loan. This is the condition ID that's in the template.And you've got the condition category, the condition number. So in in a custom list you can have a custom condition. So you'll see it's custom, but in this case it's not a custom list, so you won't see it. Then you've got the condition name, which doesn't exist in bite, but we'll be adding it. You've got the condition description, the description type which is set.When the condition is created defined in a template, you've got the stage, the condition provider. OK, it didn't do my enums. I have to fix that. The class and the responsibility. I don't know what they're going to do with that.So and then in here you want the this is the the get. I wanna get a condition. I wanna look at which one I wanna add to the loan. I wanna look at the the byte list, making my own list. This is also getting the byte list and making my own list.So I'm interested in the process of how you made this. Are you working with Claude and say look at this Figma and generate via. No, I didn't do it like that. I did it in my old fashioned world where I interviewed Tim and Leslie on all the data points that they had on every single screen.Stuck it into an Excel side by side across all the screens. So my little Excel thing and then I normalized them.Because I realized I didn't name things right and then I had all my different objects defined and then I gave it to Claude.That's what I did.So back to my e-mail to you, like, I know how I'm going to do things manually, but I have to think about it and then I instruct him and then he puts it into a structures on me. I I think it's it adds more confidence in what you have. Because yes, then I you just plot to format it, but you did all the you did all the hard work and then now I have to QA clots like he messed up a few things.Broke along the way, so I only have two. I just have the get loan conditions which is loan level and a get condition list which is the get that you want to get when you want to explore what conditions you want to add to the loan, either from the byte list or from your own custom list.Is there any reason why we're using the same member for my? Because that's the template ID, but also it's going to be the same name as the condition ID when it's saved. So this is the condition ID that is in the template, not the condition ID that's inside alone.Yeah, but those are the same name of the you can we can change it. I can change it template ID. Template ID. OK, OK, so you're not over overloading the name. Yeah, OK, I can do that.You mentioned that you had those two. Were there others that you are are yet to be done or or do those cover most of your use cases? I'm going to reuse what I already have for the other ones. So what I was what I was missing until I got to this meeting today is I don't have.An API call for bringing in the loan notes that we talked about. I don't know. I didn't know about that. I haven't figured out how to handle getting the documents that are not linked to a condition because everything in in in the get that I have is in a context of a condition.And I don't know how to handle and that, by the way, that last one is, I think that's just existing, right? Because we're just going to pull out a clear docs. So those models already exist. You're saying how do I pull back docs to be assigned to a condition?I can go look at the clear docs, right? I'm just thinking, yeah, I don't. It probably is. We can probably. There's probably a URL. We can just say that URL. Yeah. And then bring it back. Yeah, I think that.I need to take a look at it and then and then the linking mechanism, is that in the condition? I have it in a condition. Yeah, I have it. I have it as a child object in the condition. OK, so let me see what docs did because they do. They do have a link to a condition. Yeah, that's. I need to see how they did it interesting question because what we did so for the for history for the team, yeah.We built this inside clear docs. We created the ability to link a doc to a condition prior to the conditions portal existing. So I want to make sure that whatever we did there, it doesn't conflict with what we're trying to do here, so we might need to.Either do it in both places or have clear docs point to your model, but we'll want to. We'll definitely need to understand that. Do you? Who has the clear docs swagger?It's Toni. Toni announce. Do you have it? Do you want the URL? Yeah, it's dev docs. It's much better.Hey, Pace, can you? Thank you. OK, that's all I have.So I put my I put the get conditions in the get condition list. Originally I just had a get conditions. I had a whole bunch of them. Then I added the list on top and Claude just created a second API as opposed to merged it into one.So then the only thing I don't have is how to figure out how to save it.Any questions?Is this helpful?I need to make a few more updates.What? I know I'm trying to get Kelly. I'm hoping that she's done in 8 minutes so she can talk about her ramification piece. Are there questions based on what Josephine went over? I I do have so many questions. Do we have so in your?API responses, yes, but.Think I think Rusty asked this as well. So do we know what the delta is between what byte happens and what we need? I can add it to. Let me just add it as a flag in here. OK, I'll add it as a flag.I like the the concept of a like AB so you know it's a existing byte field. Yeah, I'll add that.What? What does engineering need to worry about when it comes to?You.Security roles and permissions. Like I understand that we have roles. We have an underwriter, we have a processor, a loan officer. We're gonna need a loan officer in here, so an LO. I I can't not have LOS in here, so we need that even if they're gonna act like a processor.But aside from us showing and hiding some buttons up at the top, are there other core?Inherited by things that we need to be concerned about that we need to build into this tool.I think the main thing is just what fields they can and cannot edit depending on the loan status.Um, and the condition status and maybe the exception, whatever is going on with the exception, what's going on with the exception, but that's the.That's the biggest.There's like so much data on that that we're trying to distill that into, hey, what are like the, you know, 5 to 10 different variations that we should just create as like a model of hey, these things are editable given these conditions.And there's like 5 to 10 different versions of that and then we apply the rules to it. And it's, I mean and and maybe I'm thinking about this too simplistically, but like your list just now of all the data, we're only talking 20 fields and most of it's conditions and docs. Docs already exists.Conditions already exists and and I get like the processor and the underwriter are kind of the two levels of of underwriters like the admin, the processor is like the doer. If if we can simplify it that much like maybe that's a Lauren.Uh, conversation where we just say, hey Lauren, like help us understand this. But I heard earlier somebody said there were millions of rows of there is permission data. Yes. Does that apply to these fields? Yes.Well, well, let me see if I 'cause we would have the same problem in in clear, right? We do. We have that problem in clear, but we in clear we stop at disclosure. So no one which has a lot less touches at that point. Yeah, also clear goes through.So why doesn't force the permissions on? It's like admin, right? That's that's my point. I I I love that. So my question is assume we have full access. Everyone has full access. Tell me who shouldn't have access to what? Like let's let's ignore the million rows and just.Give us a question. I asked. I asked Kelly and Brian that question. I said this question is is insane and you probably have had it for, I don't know, since you guys have had bite. Can we just take a quick look and cause the majority of these are the same and there's a theme here.Can you just create like instead of a hundreds of these? Because it's every single role we have, I don't know, we have 30 loan statuses and we probably have like 50, so 30 * 50 is 1500. But how many, how many statuses apply to this use case and and of those, how many roles are we?Gonna give access to like that should bring it down. And then how many security mechanisms do we care about for these 20 fields? I bet you it ends up being a couple of dozen as opposed to millions. That's what I was asking for. Can you do the clean up and then tell us what that is? So we have and they said little mini announcement we have.A a new employee in product. He's not new. His name is Andrew Odekirk.So Andrew reports to me now. So we have a well, I asked Brian Carlin who is this Brian, but now we have if we need him, we have Andrew, we have a bite expert who can we can assign to go do some research on. So the the was the analysis needs to happen but then.I wanna have Lauren. I want Lauren to tell me that yes, that that we we we need a business user that tells us it will be Lauren. So I wanna create like really simplistic, you know, Baskin-robbins 31 profiles. That's it at the most, you know that type, that type of concept as opposed to yeah, as simple as possible, simple, yeah.Yeah.Especially if we're, I don't know, it feels like we could easily with through the role we could we could limit this very simply through the UI without. I'm I'm, I'm trying to not have us have to worry about the burden of all of this messy obsolete.Yeah, uh, uh, profile. But I yeah, we'll we'll figure it out. It feels like at the most should be one to two different states per role depending on the loan status and condition status, right? Like it's not.I don't think it's that dramatic. The process is like majority of them. Yeah, yeah, the. But they also have different levels in underwriting. I yeah, she was saying there's like 4-4 different levels within the underwriting world, yeah.So.But I mean, just looking at that, his traffic lights, it looks like a mess. Yeah, it's it's, it's insane. Nobody can keep track of it. Yeah, I would argue that it's so complicated that we should ignore it. Yeah, like start fresh. Like, I don't let, let. Oh, that's that's good. No, that's that's how I do everything. Like, like, let's make it.Yeah, we need, we need the business to come back and tell us otherwise. Like, yeah, we're gonna go this route. Does this make sense? Yes. We can. And if they start and and I mean to a degree like Kelly is probably gonna be on the side of like, oh, you have to do this. I think we need to.Consider it, but I think we need to also look at it realistically. So it's it's good to have, it's healthy to have both sides of the house, but we'll need to and do like with with loan officers for example. OK, so are we gonna keep it so that loan officers, they're probably gonna operate within the borrower's needs list when they wanna request documents?They won't ever do anything with conditions aside from. Well, there's a note here from Mark that says convert BNL items to conditions. Yeah, so so borrow LOS will create the borrow and uses will create the conditions. Yeah, but will they won't and and a.Loan officer will add the docs, yeah, but is the loan officer responsible for assigning it to the condition or is that the processor's shot? The processor's probably not gonna want the loan officer to put anything. Well, they're gonna, they're gonna have the docs. They do that now, right?So, so I here's my argument. Loan officer is going to trigger borrower needs lists and candor, which is going to create a bunch of conditions. Loan officer will probably also ingest a bunch of docs but isn't going to do anything with it. So I I think in day one conditions will exist.And the processor will come in and they will have some docs that they can assign to the condition. Maybe we can with via Sato's tool like phase three, those get auto assigned to the condition. Yes maybe and and that ends a lot of. I think that makes more sense and the processor simply reviews it, submits to underwriting, underwriter does its thing back and forth.Pull that process forward, the more efficiency we get, right? So OK, again, we'll have Lauren. I'm, I'm heavily relying on her because she is now like Colleen, Chrissy, Jenny and Kate's equivalent. So if she says it.For somebody.I mean, I I think at some point you're gonna have to roll up your sleeves and clean up bite or or it becomes obsolete and nobody uses it anymore and we don't care if they love it to death. Uh-huh.So Candy is secretly very excited about this project because so we can. I'd prefer to go the route that like, let's make this just awesome and and make the old version obsolete. It'll still be functional but broken.OK, but kinda like the 1003, right? Like like what we do in clear like we're we're gonna Add all the cool stuff in clear. Yeah, it's still functional, but but if you want all the fun stuff, you have to go to this tool. So I would error on the side of let's go to beta. Let's just see like I don't wanna deal with a bunch of.Potential baggage. Let's just go to beta and see what happens. Did you guys agree with that approach?I mean, I think it comes to the Kelly Cardinal. We need to talk to Kelly. Sure, we'll ask her. I mean, she's not the challenge. She's she's giving us the roadblocks that we're gonna get from everybody else. Yeah, yeah, yeah.But I also don't want it to turn into this.Go from a one year to a six year project, right, which it will if we it will. If if we don't, we need to, we need to cut somewhere, you know what I mean? Yeah, this feels like a place to cut for sure on the, yeah, public permissions.
Carlos Sanchez   1:30:12Hey, guys.
Josephine Yen   1:30:12Yes, I don't know. I mean, at the end of the day, what do you other than you can create, you can create a condition, you can edit, you can link it, you can change status. That's it. Like that's not like a lot of stuff like and it's not, it's not very dangerous, especially if we audit, if we if we log it, we know what's happening and.And you know, we can if worst case, we can take these underwriter and processor roles and obfuscate them up into groups. Yes, that this uses and then so OK, you have an underwriter 1-2 and three with various controls and a processor. Yes, I I don't need to worry about all 90. I can just have these.Smaller groups, 'cause we're not. Yes. Everything else you do in the loan, you're doing invite. You're you're not. You're only coming to the screen for very limited stuff, yes.Um.Yeah, let's take a quick break and then we'll come back and I I hope to get Kelly.So, so yeah, so sounds like Sato's gonna come by one to three today for the tomorrow tomorrow for the for the demo. So he'll do our our plug in demo. Nice. So my hope is spend an hour of that and then like demoing it and then and then we'll have him feel we don't have to follow up. I took follow up flag.Out of the custom you got a then we'll have a use. We'll see what that is. Use the like what we'll have on his computer since you don't have it yet. I don't have it in the custom condition. I took it out day and tomorrow like 2 tickets like requirements that we can call a flag.It's not in the. It's not defined in a custom condition. Have us build a couple of tickets and then that would be the same requirements for. OK, I think it conditions portal. We can set it. I don't think we can make them up like that. Yes, they can set it. Yeah, I I don't have it in the template is what I'm saying. I took it off the but it's you have it in your OK, yeah.So that's so I did that one differently. OK, OK.I think that's a signature or something. Let's have something. Oh, I have a whole list for e-mail data. I didn't create that one yet. Well, I created a schedule. We'll look at it. I'd like to have a real OK, full examples here. I have already.That's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah.Yeah.Get repo. Yeah, it's gonna get repo. But we need to put it into his because his is gonna have a bunch of plugging stuff. Doesn't he? Isn't he? Is he on the enterprise? Yeah. Yeah. You voted it. Are you on personal or I'm on personal. Oh, you're on. Yes. I I don't have enterprise yet. OK, I'm gonna. We'll need to find it up there. OK. Who? Who is doing?I want Sato and Marl to build a conditions portal repo on the enterprise GitHub that we'll all use and I want him to demo his tool and I'd like him to upload like a couple of real use cases and then we all look at it together. So all right, here's what product's gonna provide and then.Engineering can see what that is and we can ask all of our questions and that'll be our our flow because when we leave here on Wednesday, Leslie's going to go in our all 50 tickets for this tool and then you guys are going to have that to start working on. So I just want to make sure we're all kind of.Agreeing to what like that handoff looks like.Oh.For the e-mail signatures with, yeah.I think it would be helpful for the processor when they're setting up this e-mail because some processors can send the e-mail on behalf of the loan officer, right? So ideally they would have the, I think they would have the ability to.Select the loan officer signature that they that the loan officer had set up. Whoa, boss user, boss user. So it's it's more that the well, I think we just need to pull it. When you go to to send the e-mail and you go to look at the signature, you can either use your own personal signature or you can.Well, do it phone officer signature that's signed to the loan. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's good. Yeah, yeah, that's that's good.But how do we do we need to know? I mean, the loan officers should know. It's amazing to me some loan officers don't know that their Outlook signature, that the marketing hub signature gets added to the end of their Outlook signature. Did you know that?So there's two signatures. Yes, you you. We can't control the marketing hub getting added. Yeah. So if you have it turned on in marketing hub, it gets added to every single one of your emails. Doesn't matter who you're sending it to.OK.Yeah.Uh, she will join us in.In about less than 10 minutes, Kelly.I also asked Lauren if she could join for a few minutes, uh, and then we'll just maybe high level.Make sure she's good with having a conversation with us, and maybe we could just ask generally some of those questions to her. She's also in a call.I just want to. I'd like to knock as much out while we're all together. You know what I mean? I think it'd be good for her to hear when we mentioned the Cardinal rules. Yeah, what came up from Kelly to see what what Lauren, Lauren thinks.The five what the do we? I I think it's the Cardinal, the Kelly Cardinal rules, not the five horse.I think we already hit on. Yeah, I don't think we need to do that on this call. You know, same document to one to many relationship of, yeah, documents to conditions.We didn't touch on bidirectional sync between byte and EPS. Well, we have that's that's the database discussion that we need to have. Yeah. So let's start with the Kelly. That one's not a big deal now that we found out the API supports it. So I actually.We probably did shot one.That's not really a block. Like it's not a no, it's not a blocker. It's just that the UI invite behaves differently, that's all.What's the other ones? So we have new condition statuses, the notes feed, one to many relationship of documents to conditions, the bidirectional sync.I think the bigger concern is the is the Kelly list.And and what is Kelly's list? Is it just her concerns about conditions portal or is it more generic? Well, it's more generic in the sense that conditions is not just a processor and underwriting thing, it's a loan thing. Uh-huh. And there are 7 to 10 other departments that have.That will be working conditions, whether they're looking at them, creating them or actually working them, changing them. So if we always all of a sudden make the statement that once alone is a condition port alone, that means that as a closer that does.Investor collateral. I have to be in the byte version and I have to be in the clear version. Yeah, and I I can't do both. We just need to understand the ramifications of that. Like So what my thought was let's how do we make this? How do we make a win win for?The area of the manufacturing chain, manufacturing chain that we're trying to solve for, right. So you got the whole supply chain instead of trying to conquer the whole thing, Big Bang, maybe we don't. We just, we took out the chunk for sales with B&L items. Now we're going to chunk processing, we're going to chunk.Chunk underwriting and then we're gonna keep on chunking, chunking, chunking until we chunk these other folks do status quo. Well, we're arguing that by doing processing and underwriting cuz those are the next two in the process. But the condition portal loan concept is a problem cuz if we have to sync the condition portal data.2 byte because of all the Domo reporting. I get that, but I don't know that you can do processing without underwriting. I think those are no, I'm saying I'm worried about processing and underwriting here and then everybody else. So my question, what is it that everybody else does that the conditions portal under some third role couldn't do?What? That part I don't know, but you know what? What are the condition like workflows that are being done by other departments? What does that look like? I mean, I was in a meeting once, but it's been a while and I did. I didn't dig too deep. They were so disorganized. It was.Is it to Mitch Mitch Peters, right?Yeah, I think it was Mimi Mitch and.Sometimes they'd have to go back and like request a condition once they get into the but all of their all of their conditions are free formed. They yeah, they were free formed, but they used the conditions portal to like do it and manage their task list more or less.And she felt it would be useful to have I I would argue again with Claude and and our power here if we can.I'd like to do as many roles as possible to yeah, put that in my note. I think I think we solved the hard ones. Processor and underwriter are the most in-depth use cases. Everybody else is like smaller. It's some subset. So it's a subset. Yeah, let's understand what those are and if we need to create three or four more roles downwind for underwriter.I'm sorry, Thunder, whatever, whatever. And and that just requires this call it, I don't know, some secondary role. And we just add that and begin with it. Let me pull up as opposed to telling them go use the old version because it won't work anymore. You know what I mean?I'll pull up the research that Tiffany had synthesized.
Kelly Mattox   1:40:38Hi there.
Josephine Yen   1:40:44Let me just take the.
Kelly Mattox   1:40:51Hi there. Hi guys.Can you hear me?
Josephine Yen   1:41:02Is Kelly's a fine Kelly there? Hi, Kelly.
Kelly Mattox   1:41:04Yeah, I'm talking. Can you guys hear me?
Josephine Yen   1:41:08Who's who's? Who's screen is on? Is that you, Josephine? Yeah. Oh, yes. But we need the Leslie's screen. The card. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yes. It's hard to hear on yours, Leslie. Yeah, it is. You can hear OK on mine. I don't know.Turn on her. Turn on. Turn on your video. We'll have. We'll have my my video. You'll free to mess around. Not your video. Your be seated. My audio is turned on. Can you hear me? Hold on. Let me turn off the audio here. Hold on, hold on. It was hard to hear Shailendra on your. Yeah, your.
Kelly Mattox   1:41:37I can hear you.
Josephine Yen   1:41:46Kelly, talk.
Shailendra Sharma   1:41:46Yes.
Kelly Mattox   1:41:47I'm here. Can you hear me? No.
Josephine Yen   1:41:48No, you sound loud and clear. We're good. How come? How come I can't hear her? My audio is all the way up.
Shailendra Sharma   1:41:54Josephine, you ignore me.
Josephine Yen   1:41:55Why can't I hear her? We can't hear shy either. Here, let me join to see if I can. Uh.Oh, hold on a second.Special as I don't know what that is. Oh, hold on.
Kelly Mattox   1:42:07OK. Yes, can you hear me?
Josephine Yen   1:42:09Kelly.Oh, shoot. What the heck? Bear with us. We're almost there. But that's it's my Surface laptop.
Kelly Mattox   1:42:14No.
Shailendra Sharma   1:42:19Are we?
Josephine Yen   1:42:20Oh, here.
Tim Borquez   1:42:22Why? Why don't you mute yourself, Josephine, real quick?
Josephine Yen   1:42:26Oh, no, no, I hear her.
Tim Borquez   1:42:30Uh, Kelly, can you try now?
Josephine Yen   1:42:31We can find out.
Kelly Mattox   1:42:32I can. I can hear you guys. Can you hear me?
Josephine Yen   1:42:36Yeah, it's coming. Yeah. Can you turn off? Try again, Kelly.
Kelly Mattox   1:42:40Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Josephine Yen   1:42:43Yeah, right.
Kelly Mattox   1:42:45Yay!
Josephine Yen   1:42:46You're on the big screen. We're all staring. We're all staring. It's great. OK, so, so Kelly, we are all here in Irvine and we we've got Tony, Leslie, myself, Josephine.
Kelly Mattox   1:42:49I see that. Thanks. I'm gonna turn off my camera, yes.Yep.
Josephine Yen   1:43:06Got Annie, Scott, Rusty and Tim Borquez.
Kelly Mattox   1:43:11Hello.
Josephine Yen   1:43:13Hi. Hey. So we're doing a two day deep dive on our favorite topic, Conditions Portal and so far we've gone through the design. Leslie and Tim did sort of a walk through etcetera and.
Kelly Mattox   1:43:13Hi.Yep.Yeah.
Josephine Yen   1:43:29Josephine went through kind of a data models and and we're starting to get into some of the like the cautionary tales, things to be considered about and folks keep bringing up kind of Kelly's 5 cardinal roles of conditions and wanted to find out if you could just.
Kelly Mattox   1:43:44OK.
Josephine Yen   1:43:48Walk through that with us. We're we're recording all of this for take away but I just wanted your if you could give us just just kind of give the team like your viewpoint on things and and things we should be aware of and and things that are like you know you've been here for a long time so you know kind of the where the skeletons are so.
Kelly Mattox   1:43:51OK.Yeah.Yeah.
Josephine Yen   1:44:07I don't know if we have that document somewhere, but we could start there. But but is that in USBC or in box service? There's one in the office there, but it might be plugged into it. I have a screen, I have something. What do you do? So just a minute Kelly, we'll we'll share the screen and then we'll we'll have you talk.
Kelly Mattox   1:44:26OK, OK.
Josephine Yen   1:44:31Thanks for making time. Sorry, it's an ad hoc thing. I didn't forget about you, Kelly.
Kelly Mattox   1:44:33That's all good.Oh good. No, I appreciate it. I know I always have the Kelly Cardinal rules, unfortunately, and I think it's I'll try and try and mirror the best that I can of what we discussed the other day because we were on the phone for about an hour.
Josephine Yen   1:44:46Yes.OK, so it's it's semi fresh maybe.
Kelly Mattox   1:44:52Um, yeah.Somewhat, yeah.
Josephine Yen   1:44:58Candy says hi.
Kelly Mattox   1:44:582.Who says hi?
Josephine Yen   1:45:00Andy, she's her and I were talking about your and my participation in the OPS thing.
Kelly Mattox   1:45:09Got it. Okay.
Josephine Yen   1:45:11I gave her two options. We either do the 150 backlog or we we look at the conditions portal demo.
Kelly Mattox   1:45:19Let's look at the conditions portal demo, please.
Josephine Yen   1:45:20That's what I thought you'd say.
Kelly Mattox   1:45:23Yeah, it's not 150, by the way, so you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Josephine Yen   1:45:29It's it's 180. It's it's grown. Um.
Kelly Mattox   1:45:31No, it's less. It's probably less than 75.
Josephine Yen   1:45:35So I think uh Leslie. OK, so Leslie's gonna power up and then she's gonna share the the the slide and then and then like Kelly, we can start now like like like as we wait for the slide so so.
Tim Borquez   1:45:48Oh.
Kelly Mattox   1:45:48OK.
Leslie Chang   1:45:49Like, like, like hope we have somebody.
Josephine Yen   1:45:50Like.Hope we have somebody up.
Kelly Mattox   1:45:54Yeah.
Josephine Yen   1:45:55I'm I'm.
Leslie Chang   1:45:55I'm, I'm, I'm here now.
Josephine Yen   1:46:01Can you turn off your audio? Yeah.
Leslie Chang   1:46:01Turn off the audio. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, my audio is your mic.
Josephine Yen   1:46:04You're Mike. Mike. Oh, yeah, Mike.
Kelly Mattox   1:46:09Got it? Better.
Josephine Yen   1:46:17Yep, here we are. Thanks.
Kelly Mattox   1:46:17All right. Don't break down my reports. I like that. OK. I think the biggest thing that I was talking through were a couple of things. Number one is we start to build a conditions portal and I heard you guys talking, I think a little bit about it when.
Josephine Yen   1:46:33Nothing.
Kelly Mattox   1:46:34We do. Can you hear me?
Josephine Yen   1:46:37Yeah, yeah, we lost the screen there.
Kelly Mattox   1:46:39Yeah, we did lose the screen share. I think the biggest, one of the biggest things that we have to remember is access levels for it. And I think you guys were talking briefly about that. When we talk about giving people access to these, we say, hey, underwriters and and processors are the most important, the first thing.Just keep in mind that we have multiple names or multiple roles in byte that a processor uses, right? So we have a loan processor, we have a processor two, we have a processor 3. So when you handicap them, you handicap them.Unless you allow all three roles to get in. Same thing with underwriter. We have an underwriter role. We have underwrite level 123 and four. So we now have candor role.Roles that we've added for all of those levels as well. So anytime that we roll out something and we give it a new role name, even though we're copying it from the old role, it's still a new role I think, and it doesn't allow the user to actually get inside of clear.I'll give you an example. The new Candor, I I think it was the new Candor ones that we rolled out today or like this week. The user can't use True and then launch out to get into True. Does that make sense? So.They actually have to log out of their Northern Candor role. They have to log back into their Processor 3 role. Then they have to go to True because that does not allow them to get to the new product that we're delivering. Does that make sense?
Josephine Yen   1:48:21So it does. So let me ask like a fundamental question. My my correct me where I'm wrong here. I I want I would like or in clear so that we're building this in clear.
Kelly Mattox   1:48:25Mhm.OK.Mhm.
Josephine Yen   1:48:36Um, and I'm I'm looking. I'm trying to look at it very simplicity. Simplicitly. You have a loan officer.A.Hold on, Leslie's going.
Kelly Mattox   1:48:49She's plugging in.
Josephine Yen   1:48:52There we go. So can you hear me? OK, OK, cool. So you have the you have the loan officer, you have a processor, you have an underwriter and then you have like everybody else call that like post underwriting.
Kelly Mattox   1:48:53Got it.I can, and you're good. Thank you.Mhm.
Josephine Yen   1:49:09Conditions portal. Right now we have two roles. We have the processor who will who who doesn't really create conditions. They they sort of, they sort of assign, they upload docs, they assign docs, they reach out to the borrower.
Kelly Mattox   1:49:22Yep.Yep.
Josephine Yen   1:49:25They set statuses, blah blah blah. The underwriter kind of does the inverse. They create the conditions, they sign off on the conditions, but they're not like linking docs to conditions. Would you would you argue that regardless of how many types of processor or underwriter that they could all be?
Kelly Mattox   1:49:27Mhm.Correct.
Josephine Yen   1:49:45Obfuscated into kind of generally those two permission sets.Like, is there a is an underwriter 3 doing something special that an underwriter 2 can't do with conditions, linking, et cetera? You know what I mean?
Kelly Mattox   1:49:52Um, yes, for the.No, except for we talked about that yesterday in the exception. If we're not requiring them to use the exception checkboxes, then that's the only thing on an underwriter role that would need to be different based off of.The underwriter role pushing out, right? A processor. There would be a difference because a processor is allowed to sign off on some conditions because they do have processor 3 conditions, but the other two processor roles will not be allowed to sign sign off on any conditions.
Josephine Yen   1:50:32So, so you have processors that when you say sign off, they can, they can effectively close a condition or satisfy a condition. OK.
Kelly Mattox   1:50:40Yes, yes, clear it.Mhm.
Josephine Yen   1:50:44And then everybody post underwriting we like Mitch and and folks. So we're we have this conundrum like assuming that we build the conditions portal if the condition portal breaks bite or.
Kelly Mattox   1:50:50Mhm.Mhm.Mhm.
Josephine Yen   1:50:59Conditions for a loan like like let's assume that that's the case or it makes it irreversible. Is there anything like like with post underwriting? What's the close? Is it just a read only at that point or or like what? Like who? Who would a post?
Kelly Mattox   1:51:03Yep.So you have closers and funders who sign off and add conditions and pass them to the next one. They also move them post closing. Post closing will go in and they're now actually adding conditions to loans based on loans not being purchased from investor purchasing.Getting steps back.Mhm.
Josephine Yen   1:51:33That role, would you argue that the verbs of what you can do, they're no different. If you took some of the actions of an underwriter and the processor and called it this post underwriter role, like there's no new or different functionality, right? In other words, I'm just.
Kelly Mattox   1:51:45Mhm.
Josephine Yen   1:51:52I'm just swapping out existing functionality and and grouping it into a new role. Is is that right or is there some new?
Kelly Mattox   1:51:58No, I I think, I think yes, a little bit to the function itself, but what they're allowed to sign off is very specific based on what their name is, so.
Josephine Yen   1:52:08That's that's. I think that's OK. Can I can I using the same all the same behavior and functionality just applying just just to do that? OK, that's what I'm trying.
Kelly Mattox   1:52:11Yeah.It's the class that's assigned to it, so and what they're allowed to sign off.
Josephine Yen   1:52:19Yeah, so OK, can I make this general statement? If the class is processor 3 and I am a processor, then I can do whatever I want to that condition. I can change the data, I can do whatever I want. It's my condition to play with.
Kelly Mattox   1:52:24Yeah.Mhm.No.Depending upon the condition and if it's editable or not.
Josephine Yen   1:52:38So if the condition is defined as not editable, the only field that that controls is the description field. But all data fields like I should be able to change any field if if class is underwriter and that sorry class is processor and a person logging in as processor I can change.
Kelly Mattox   1:52:46Correct.
Josephine Yen   1:52:56Anything on that loan a a condition except for description if description is set as not editable, is that correct?
Kelly Mattox   1:53:02Well, the based on what we're getting. So we're going to remove access to the responsibility because we don't want them changing or editing a responsibility. And then depending upon what I think today they can edit and they can move it to PTF, yes, so.Yes, they should be able to move it to PTF so they can move this stage of the loan, correct?
Josephine Yen   1:53:22OK, so if I'm in, so taking that exact same example, if the condition description is saying that it's not editable, then that that that is a definition across the board. I don't care who you are. OK, so I'm going to take that off the table. So if the logged in person is.
Kelly Mattox   1:53:27Mhm.Yeah, it doesn't matter, yeah.Correct.
Josephine Yen   1:53:40Their security profile matches the profile that is in that class. They can do whatever they want to it.
Kelly Mattox   1:53:44Yes, correct.
Josephine Yen   1:53:47And that's even for closing funding and post closing.
Kelly Mattox   1:53:52Correct. Just remember that you have multiple the one. So underwriters you have 5 different roles that sign off conditions to the one underwriter class in the drop down.
Josephine Yen   1:53:55OK.So could we make our lives easier? So could we make our lives easier and say, I'm an underwriter one, the class is underwriter one. I can do whatever I want with that. I'm an underwriter 2 and sorry, I'm an underwriter one and the class is underwriter 2. Sorry.Door shut. Can't get in the club.Can I do that? Can we do that 'cause that will make it a lot easier for us for rollout.
Kelly Mattox   1:54:32Hmm.I I know, but that's not how all the conditions are inside of Bite currently. So that would be a whole change to everything we have today. All of our auto conditions, all of the conditions inside of Bite if you're looking to put multiple drop downs in the class for different underwriter.
Josephine Yen   1:54:50Here's another here's another way to think about it. I think what I think we need is imagine in Excel I need a list of. I need a list of call it five, maybe six or seven roles that the conditions portal supports.
Kelly Mattox   1:54:51Statuses.Mhm.
Josephine Yen   1:55:07Which will roll up a bunch of the bytes. So I'm gonna make it a loan officer, processor one and two, underwriter one and two, and then closer and funder. I'm just making that up. Maybe there's more, but for each of those.
Kelly Mattox   1:55:10Yeah.
Josephine Yen   1:55:23What? I don't know if you do what they can do or what they can't do, but like, give me the give me the role of what they're allowed to do. And then I I think that.That we we we just built that into clear. I think that would be the easiest route and then we what we want the mapping when you log in depending on your the one of of 400 roles will wire those up to to roll up into one of these seven roles.
Kelly Mattox   1:55:47Mhm.
Josephine Yen   1:55:51That way if you're a processor one or two, you roll up to processor. If you're a processor 3, you roll up to processor 2 and that way we just have our own sort of mini version and and I I I I don't want conditions portal to have to have 400 rolls. That's that's what I'm trying to solve for. So what is the lowest common denominator?And then and then what are the permissions within that and that way we can provide that to engineering is that?
Kelly Mattox   1:56:17Are are you mapping your own? Because like every a lot of the other things that we've built for clear, like our pipelines and such, don't map all of the roles, right? So like we have three different processor roles and only one was provided access.Or two, I think they ended up adding. So the idea is, is that depending upon the product that you're delivering in the new clear screen, it needs to be tied to either the specific name of the role, so like a processor three if you're signing off conditions, but in every other thing that you build in clear or pipe.
Josephine Yen   1:56:34Yes, yes, probably, yeah.
Kelly Mattox   1:56:53Line or VOEVOE screen it it it it's the it's the joint thing of it being a one processor. It doesn't matter what we call them. Certain things give them an extra responsibility being a a 1-2 or a three.
Josephine Yen   1:56:55Yeah, we can make it up.
Kelly Mattox   1:57:11But generically, if you're going to look at something, you can either decipher whether it's going to be every loan processor is going to like what it's tied to inside of byte, or what you know specifically if it is something that we have to give them access. Does that make sense?
Josephine Yen   1:57:27It does. So I yeah, I think we can.
Kelly Mattox   1:57:27Sorry, because there's an indicator that we actually tie it to. So like loan officers are tied to like a disclosure LO, but they're still tied to an LO role inside of Bite, right? So there is somewhere a mechanism in Bite and I'm trying to open up the.
Josephine Yen   1:57:44Mm.
Kelly Mattox   1:57:47The security profiles right now to see if I can see it. If not, I'll have to have Brian help me find where that lives. Where when you create a new security profile, there's like a base of where it comes from and what what responsibility it has. Yeah, almost.
Josephine Yen   1:57:59Oh, inherited.
Kelly Mattox   1:58:03And then you can change what is done with it afterwards, right? So there's other indicators that show that it can they can do something else like self disclosures in clear allow them to do, you know, change edit fees. We give them other.Other rules on top of what the base rule is. Does that make sense? But it's almost like if I create a new role that's tied to that base role, that base role is what should drive them into something. So everyone should be able to go in your condition portal who has a base role of an LO or a profile or a processor, just as an example.Simple and then AP3 would be added in an extra layer of OK they can sign off their class equals this.
Josephine Yen   1:58:45Yeah, no, that's exactly the same pattern. So I I think we want we what I'm trying to do is limit the number of base rolls to like 5 or six. I I don't want 30.
Kelly Mattox   1:58:47OK, good.So loan officers do look at conditions, but if you're going to give them access to see them inside of clear and bite, I think you should be OK, right? Your production assistance in some areas might help the processor, almost like a junior processor role. A lot of them help.
Josephine Yen   1:59:04Upgrade. Yeah.
Kelly Mattox   1:59:16So I would suggest that you use your production assistant. You would use your processor as your base role P3, being able to sign off your underwriter, right? And then you're going to look at your closer and funder roles, right? Closer slash funder roles.And then you would be looking at your OST closing.
Josephine Yen   1:59:36OK, Kelly, would the closer and funder be kind of like the same role or are they? Is there enough distinction between the two that they need two separate ones?Is it wet and state dependent?
Kelly Mattox   1:59:46Um.Let me see if it's all tied to one. Let me see if I can find that indicator to answer that question for you.I'm looking. Oh, we got the little list up here. Oh, that's good.I'm waiting for that to come up, so.
Josephine Yen   2:00:02This is, this is we're getting to the to the friction point where we got stuck last time. So we're we're I want to get this time. I want to power through it.
Kelly Mattox   2:00:11Oh, the the conversation around the roles.
Josephine Yen   2:00:14Just just conditions portal itself, I think, I think got a little sidetracked with some of these discussions, you know what I mean?
Kelly Mattox   2:00:21Yeah, yeah, it's hard cause if if really you're going to change enough in conditions portal to where bite will no longer be available for anyone to see, really anyone after a nut alone goes through underwriting. If it's QC, if it's anyone, they're going to have to see that.If that's what you're looking for, 'cause don't forget you still have QC as well, so I would add QC to that list.
Josephine Yen   2:00:41Yeah, that's what I want and yeah and and I I want to know like OK can that roll into, can that go into one role or can it does it need to be two or three and and what's the difference and when we can build that I just want to I I need it like in an Excel spreadsheet. I need it like the 8 roles you described.
Kelly Mattox   2:00:54Right.
Josephine Yen   2:01:01I wanna know like what can the LO do or not do? What does the assistant do or not do? Or is an assistant identical to an LO and we can roll them up together even better? But I just need to know. I need us to ultimately know the difference like you mentioned APA processor.
Kelly Mattox   2:01:06Mm.
Josephine Yen   2:01:21Three can do certain things with certain types. I need that part of it documented somewhere so we can tell engineering so that they're aware of it because we won't natively inherit that with what we're building.
Kelly Mattox   2:01:21Right.OK. Do you agree with the PA thing? Because we have so many ways that we allow our teams to work that the PA is one that needs to be identified as well?
Josephine Yen   2:01:45Well, unless you I I don't agree with any new role unless you you meaning whoever described to me that the role has different permissions. Like if if if a PA behaves identically to an LO, then I would say no ever. You know we'll have one role because why? Why do I need a separate role?
Kelly Mattox   2:01:55Mhm.
Josephine Yen   2:02:05Per role if there's no that there's not different permissions. Am I thinking about that right?
Kelly Mattox   2:02:09Um, yes, but the problem is, is how you're connecting it from bite and the what they're logging into in as that's up to you.
Josephine Yen   2:02:17Oh, but we're gonna, we're gonna make it up. So whatever we do in clear, we we, yeah, we we we're gonna obfuscate it with our own label. So we can call it LO slash LOA, which happens to encompass these following 7.
Kelly Mattox   2:02:21You're gonna make it up, okay.
Josephine Yen   2:02:33Bytes fields or roles, for example, like I I want to have as few as possible. I only want to. I only want to add 1 when there's a difference in functionality.
Kelly Mattox   2:02:45Right.
Josephine Yen   2:02:45So anyway, we'll figure that part out, but that's that's kind of where I'm going.
Kelly Mattox   2:02:48So this is like the name of it which drives the permissions for this, but here it says the role is loan officer and this ties back to the role like on the home screen of where that name displays. But if we start to identify things as a role here and not necessarily as the naming convention.I think we will have a lot more success when we allow people to get into clear or anything that we're building in general.
Josephine Yen   2:03:15OK.I see. So essentially the name is the clone of a role. You can give it whatever and then we we can layer in an overlay of permissions. The role is the deeper. That's the that's the foundation. It's the foundation, yeah.
Kelly Mattox   2:03:24Right.Correct.Mm-hmm.
Josephine Yen   2:03:34Yeah, you. We don't wanna be stuck to a random child that that might have siblings. Yeah. And that's how it would. Yeah, yeah.Yeah, perfect.Perfect.
Kelly Mattox   2:03:51Yeah, and then your closer and funder are separate roles. It looks like it's funder and then there's a closer in here somewhere. I find it like that.
Josephine Yen   2:04:00Imagine that's wet state, dry state driven.
Kelly Mattox   2:04:04No, yes and no. I mean some of our areas work like that. That's the other part that we're looking forward to hopefully making some changes is, is having like a wet and a dry state and everybody on the same page. Right now we have multiple, we had multiple ownerships of those divisions and they didn't always.Agree and they mixed in each other. So the idea is is that yes, it should be wet versus dry.Cause a wet and in a wet the closer does almost all of it and the funder really just validates the documents that come back. They're more like a post closing piece, but that's on wet and on dry they actually have two separate.
Josephine Yen   2:04:38Yeah.
Kelly Mattox   2:04:49Division like 2 separate things cause they get the docs back, they review them, they order the wire, they balance with title, they do it very differently.
Josephine Yen   2:05:00Awesome. OK, that helps. Any questions guys on the roles. So I I think we need to. I think we're gonna. So let's let's let's go back to the list. OK, we we can have Kelly explain. Was that on the list? Well, kind of.
Kelly Mattox   2:05:01Anything else? OK.
Josephine Yen   2:05:17Let me go back. I can't. I gotta go back.I took a screenshot, Leslie. Yeah, it's charging super slow, so OK, so.
Kelly Mattox   2:05:26OK, so maintain complete bite integrity. Is that the other one or where are you at? What are we doing that each one?
Josephine Yen   2:05:33Yeah, so, yeah, so don't break Domo reports. So what that means is even though we have the richer data set, we still need to save the data to Byte so that these Domo reports can still be generated so that it looks like nothing's really changed, OK.
Kelly Mattox   2:05:37Right.Correct.Correct.
Josephine Yen   2:05:48The next one is it's kind of the same thing, meaning that we still have to save the data to byte.
Kelly Mattox   2:05:54Yeah, I mean, I feel like if if you're putting something somewhere, the idea is, is that I guess at some point in time there'll be an audit, there'll be something that comes back, somebody will ask a question and we just need to be able to see that data that was entered in on the condition screen if it's not the same as.
Josephine Yen   2:05:55All right.
Kelly Mattox   2:06:13So what's in byte?
Josephine Yen   2:06:14Question. We had a we were wondering, we were talking about an audit concept. So imagine that you have you have a condition and and things can happen to a condition. It can be created, it can have notes added, it can have status changed, it can have.
Kelly Mattox   2:06:20Sure.
Josephine Yen   2:06:30Documents linked and unlinked, et cetera. Do you do you think all of that into an audit table? Like who did it, when they did it, what did they do? Do you think that is enough or valuable and and and and maybe not in the conditions portal, but at least linked so it can be brought up on a Domo report? Do you think that's?
Kelly Mattox   2:06:42Yeah.Yes, yes, cause at at some point in time someone's going to ask how did this get here? Why was the wrong thing attached to a? Why was the wrong condition attached to this and someone signed it off? Who did that? That'll be the first thing that comes through it just as an example.
Josephine Yen   2:06:50Stops this.OK. What do we have this today? Does this by do that today? Do we know all of that auditing?
Kelly Mattox   2:07:08I can tell if somebody deletes it. I can tell if somebody, yeah, attaches it. If someone signs it off, yes.
Josephine Yen   2:07:14OK, so I think a minimum we need to do what Byte does, but if we can do more than we we can do more. OK, that's an easy one.
Kelly Mattox   2:07:17Yeah.Yeah, and really, I think cause you're still using the Byte API right to push the data back. So Byte should have that API of whatever's happening. Well, although now it's gonna show API 22 or whatever API bot we're using, huh?
Josephine Yen   2:07:25Yes.But but the the thing, yeah, but but but the the The thing is on the documents. So we can do many document. The same document can be linked to multiple conditions in bite. You can't do that.
Kelly Mattox   2:07:44OK, yeah, then, yeah, you need to definitely capture that.
Josephine Yen   2:07:44So, so and and we're gonna have more metadata like flags and notes that may not exist though. So well I think the the the take away is we need to we need to log minimum what's there today but we we need to support our new model for.
Kelly Mattox   2:07:51Yeah.Yes.
Josephine Yen   2:08:02Many to many concepts, but OK, that sounds the question that's in my head is is the full data set of condition in one system outside of byte and you sync whatever data you want to byte or is the full data set of condition.Is whatever. There's a set that exists outside of byte and then the rest of it is in byte and together A + B is a full set. So that's the latter is how you're doing it elsewhere, right? The condition itself will live in.Byte, but metadata will exist in clear, so probably want to follow a similar pattern. That's an engineering question, but yeah, I wouldn't. I don't know. I wouldn't. The problem is if you one, you're it's gonna be in. It's gonna. If you're gonna use the API, it's gonna be in byte anyway.
Kelly Mattox   2:08:56Mm-hmm.
Josephine Yen   2:08:56Yeah, I don't wanna so then then into two places then well or it's or it's partial and we just join it.
Kelly Mattox   2:09:06Just remember that again, if it's an API call, the API call, unless we're able to use the new one that shows who does it, byte doesn't tell us who does it.
Josephine Yen   2:09:07Yes.
Kelly Mattox   2:09:18When it's done through the API. So like anybody who does anything through EPS or through clear.
Josephine Yen   2:09:21Oh, because it's uh, it's using a system account, right? Yes.
Kelly Mattox   2:09:24Correct. So while it gives us when it happened, it doesn't say who did it.
Josephine Yen   2:09:30Uh, we run into that same issue with the modified daytime done with the API LB server will.That invite, it's user level. I think these are dates or they have this timeline too. They have modified. They have modified. They don't have. I don't. They don't have modified, but they have the status. But there's no history. So like there's five statuses. The latest one is what you get.Yeah, so if I if you modify them, like you, I get invited.But if you do it with the UI, it's server time, then you'll know types of this, yeah.OK. So that we'll take that as a as a research. So I I think we know what we want to do. But I think what you're saying is we use the data, we source the data that we need that is that byte supports and then all the extra stuff we do it outside and then the the A + B is the full data set. Yeah, let let Domo.
Kelly Mattox   2:10:20OK.
Josephine Yen   2:10:35Do the joint I I don't. In other words I don't think no, but the full data set is what we need for the to render the UI. That's what I say. We have to merge the two of the data. I don't know that we need to render you. I think Domo is I I don't know that we need an audit tool in clear docs. I think we can do that through Domo.No, what what I'm saying is that when we get the payload to render the data in our conditions portal UI, our API is going to take data from some database. Yes. And then from both databases. Yes. Yeah, that's sort of thing. OK, OK, we're not, I don't believe that we should store duplicate data.Again, I'll defer to engineering, but I would we we want a it's OK to have two sources of truth that are hybrid. OK, OK. So then #3 is which I I think, yes, I'll. So Kelly, can you did did you say?
Kelly Mattox   2:11:18Like.Support downstream roles now.
Josephine Yen   2:11:28That the condition portal that we have now could be used to not just for processing and underwriting, but for closure, funder, all those other departments.
Kelly Mattox   2:11:39Well, it's going to need to be if that's what you want. If you want them to get the same or have the same capability, if if an underwriter is adding a condition for a closer to sign off and they're using the additional fields that you're giving them, they're going to need to use that.
Josephine Yen   2:11:41Provided.So question.
Kelly Mattox   2:11:56Yes.
Josephine Yen   2:11:57I am. I am AI am somebody downstream of an underwriter other than and I don't for now forget about who the roles are. Create condition, update status, add note, add flag, link documents.
Kelly Mattox   2:12:02mm-hmmOK.
Josephine Yen   2:12:14Request from borrower or whatever. It is all of the stuff that exists today. Is there anything else that that I didn't describe like a new piece of functionality that one of those roles would need to do that that we haven't accounted for? That's the question.
Kelly Mattox   2:12:28They would need to move a condition and clear it. I don't know if you hear said that.
Josephine Yen   2:12:32What do you mean by move a condition from prior to doc to park? Oh, stage, stage, stage. That's just a status. It's a stage. It's a field. It's got to be either met prior to getting your loan documents, PPD. It's got to be met prior to funding. It's just it's just the data.
Kelly Mattox   2:12:35So it's move a status from prior to dog stage. Yeah, stage. We didn't say status, but yeah.Yep.
Josephine Yen   2:12:52Those are. That's existing functionality. Yes, right. Is there anything else? Like do they extract the data? Do they do they do they do anything funky with the?
Kelly Mattox   2:12:55Correct, yeah.
Josephine Yen   2:13:05What? What? What actions do they do that our current conditions portal doesn't support is my question. I'm gonna make up something. Do they generate a letter that has all these different conditions and they send it back to the investor? I'm making up stuff. I mean, are we missing anything?
Kelly Mattox   2:13:18Right. I don't think.
Josephine Yen   2:13:21That would make it so that they can't complete their job by using the condition portal and they have to straddle between the condition portal and the byte whatever screens.
Kelly Mattox   2:13:34Well, they're gonna have to possibly save things back, right? Like documents. They're gonna get a doc package to sign that's signed back. They're gonna get, they're gonna have to generate out a 4506 to include in there or something to generate out, right?OK.Yeah.
Josephine Yen   2:14:03It'll so you'll still have all of your your byte screens to do other things like you're not bound to just this window because you're already in byte if that helps. But but can I take away your the current byte out-of-the-box condition screen and no one would be upset?
Kelly Mattox   2:14:08OK.OK.
Josephine Yen   2:14:22And give you the new condition portal screen. Can we do that and nobody would be upset. They won't be disrupted. They can still do their jobs.You're nodding, yes.
Kelly Mattox   2:14:32I know, no, I'm just. I'm thinking, no, I'm not making it like you off that easy.
Josephine Yen   2:14:38And and again this will be a this will be kind of a Lauren ask like like we need to ask that like hey we want to yeah we wanna 'cause my argument is if we're already building the core functionality and to me it this just sounds like.
Kelly Mattox   2:14:42OK, so if they get.Yeah.
Josephine Yen   2:14:54Permissions and roles creating a couple more profiles. Yeah, or I don't know if I'm using the right nomenclature, but like if we're not adding any new features then I I I think it's fine to have extra roles if if it means having a.Full uh downstream all on our same all on our tool. So then that means three and four is checks. It's checked off, right? So.
Kelly Mattox   2:15:14So I have a.So I have a question. Yeah, the existing pipeline would be the one of the other questions that we have because someone's going to have to sometimes go into the new one, sometimes use the old one, right? But.
Josephine Yen   2:15:20Yeah.Oh, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna merge the two data. So we're gonna whatever data it does not exist in byte, we will store it somewhere else. Whatever data does exist in byte will still be in byte. We're gonna pull those two together. We're gonna stitch it and give you one UI for it.
Kelly Mattox   2:15:46So the current, so as we roll out, do I go into the new portal for every loan? Is that the idea?
Josephine Yen   2:15:46So it's not going to change talking about.Yes. And the data will be there. No, I think are we saying, yes, that's what I'm saying. Oh, you're saying like I'm saying the data's there. It's the same data. Everybody. Yeah, the same data's there. Limited. Hey, here's a beta group. No, because expand that group and then so on because the beta group, the problem with the beta group is.I'm a new condition portal loan, but then I'm working on a condition and then the guy downstream is not in my beta group and then all the other people working that loan is not in my beta group. It's a problem. Question could you? Yes, agreed. So the loan is now a condition portal loan, but that's different.
Kelly Mattox   2:16:21Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Josephine Yen   2:16:31Different from what you said, which is, could I have this group like a lab of downstream? Yes, that's a different thing. Yes. I think we need that flexibility cuz I certainly don't want to bring down CMG production. Yes, total processors. So I think what we would say is we'd go to operations and we'd say give me.So a group of ellos, processors, underwriters, post closers, all the way down that are in the whole value chain in this group. Yeah. They will all be on conditions port only. Yeah. And we'll have them test it for a month. We'll fix things. Yes. And then if we like it, we'll roll it to the rest of the company. Yeah.
Kelly Mattox   2:17:04Yeah.
Josephine Yen   2:17:07I think, yeah, it needs to be in production, but I think in in a lab, yeah, right. But I think what we're agreeing to is that if we're gonna turn it on, it, it's on all the way downstream for all of those seven roles or whatever. The whole chain, yeah, arrow.You can't be in and out. Can I ask a dumb question and maybe you're answering it, but the existing pipeline that did not use conditions portal that has conditions out there in the current by. It's a good question. What happens? Is it all technically if you don't open it?
Kelly Mattox   2:17:36That.
Josephine Yen   2:17:38And once you open it in conditions portal, you've sort of tainted it, right? Like it's now this new data model. So you could technically argue that well, what what Gina did for her, one of her projects, Kelly, you created a custom field for her, right?Like a candor field, you created a custom field and then so all only her alone. I forget she was explaining it to me, but if that field is checked then those are those are hers, hers for the lab for her measurements. Anything else is not.So we could do the same thing. Can we?
Kelly Mattox   2:18:11Yeah, but the the challenges is when you guys get to the end result, let's just talk about like your post closing all of those folks and everywhere investor purchasing, am I insuring, FHA insuring all of those people, you're now talking about people who support.Every channel throughout CMG, so their reports, you can't just like we have two MI insuring analysts. You can't stop them from doing their job across the board. Does that make sense?
Josephine Yen   2:18:32Well, I think when.No, but you're saying, but but you were saying that we can pull one person out into this lab. Alternatively, let's well, bear with me. What if? What if I'm making this up? Kelly, tell me where I'm.
Kelly Mattox   2:18:55OK.
Josephine Yen   2:18:56I'm wrong.Could we, I'm making this up. We flag a loan like pretend that we have that group of people. But I I understand that in that group there might be people that do everything. So there's this, there's certain people that might need to be in the old and the new way. Could we, let's say we could flag the loan, every loan opened by this.
Kelly Mattox   2:19:08Yeah.Correct.
Josephine Yen   2:19:17Underwrite, I'm sorry, loan officer starting, you know, February 1st is considered a conditions portal loan. So let's assume we have a flag for that. When you're in bite, when you click on the conditions button, could that button look at that flag and either open?Legacy if if it's false, or our new tool if it's positive. That way the user simply does what they always do and we present them with a screen accordingly.So it's one menu item, two different screens, bite screen or clear screen, and we decide that by the flag.
Kelly Mattox   2:19:51Maybe.I would feel way more comfortable if we talked to some people like in on the back end piece cause I don't know all of the things that they're doing. Yeah, the Colleen and I know, I know you're you're you're like just trying to generically.
Josephine Yen   2:19:57So yeah.No, yeah, we'll need. We're just, we're just no reaction.Yeah.Because I I want to, I don't want to stop people from doing their jobs and I don't want to go to Candy and say give me force somebody to only do a like a portion of their job. So how do we, how do we get our tool out there in a in a isolated environment and how do we make it as easy as possible? So Rusty, the question was.
Kelly Mattox   2:20:11Yeah.
Josephine Yen   2:20:26Could we assume that we flag like 5 loan officers as conditional condition portal loan officers? So any loan they open from a date, you know January 15th forward, we flag as a condition portal loan. It's a it's a new flag invite.
Kelly Mattox   2:20:35Mhm.
Josephine Yen   2:20:44With me, yeah. So in Bite, I don't care who you are. When you open up the when you click on the conditions menu that exists today, Bite will look at that flag and either open our new conditions portal or it will open the current old conditions portal. That way you already do stuff based on dates.Flags. It doesn't seem that different. Yeah, that way we we IT controls the window. You're you're gonna get the conditions window or you're gonna get the old byte window and it'll be based on loan. So if if a user is only doing stuff for this new LO.It'll always be the new conditions window, but it solves for downstream where people who are doing warehouse line stuff where they they are, they're not necessarily bound to like a small group depending on what window, depending on the loan, it will, it will open accordingly and and we'll train them that hey you're you may start to see these new.Loan types or something?I can't think of anything off the top of my head. We have, we have things that can fire off of like button clicks. So it sounds, it sounds reasonable. We have to look into it. OK, Tony, what what were you gonna say? I I was just going back to my saying, well, it's the same as.The If you click on GFE on this loan that said a loan estimate, it's gonna say this file needs to be on the loan estimate.You click on loan estimate and you try to do a GFE. This file has to be whatever. It just tells you you can't use that. So like is that a macro? Is that a byte macro? Is that a macro? It's a it's.
Kelly Mattox   2:22:20No, it's actually it's the fields inside of Byte, and that's how it was built to toggle between the two.
Josephine Yen   2:22:22OK.OK, I'm not arguing that's the answer, but that is a that is a recommendation.
Kelly Mattox   2:22:27Yeah.Yeah.
Josephine Yen   2:22:31It's a customization of some kind that right seems like it follows existing pattern and it's it's solves for some of these I think. I think we're trying to say we'd like all roles to be included in the scope. Let's minimize those as much as we can and.And try to accommodate for those, but let's also accommodate for roles that may not be specific in our lab. They might still be getting non condition portal loans.
Kelly Mattox   2:22:51Yeah.Yeah, I think, I think your, yeah, your class is the most important thing. Everybody else should be able to see it and log into it, right? Cause do you really care if a PA or if somebody attaches a condition to it? Probably not. Loan officer's not gonna do what they're not supposed to do and they're not gonna launch from bite anyways, so.
Josephine Yen   2:22:57Kelly Kelly.Yeah.Right. And that's my point. It's.And we're gonna have, we're gonna have full logging anyway. If it's not alone, it's been working before, yeah.
Kelly Mattox   2:23:17Yeah.Yeah.
Josephine Yen   2:23:21Yeah, Kelly, does that does what is what just just got check me here is what Mark described. It sounds like things we've done already. You click a button it it checks if a custom field exists for that loan and if it doesn't it navigates you somewhere or or somewhere else.
Kelly Mattox   2:23:22I do not.Yeah, it's or it stops you. Yeah, it tells you you can't and that you have to go to this other screen like conditions too. You can call it or.
Josephine Yen   2:23:43OK.
Kelly Mattox   2:23:49Whatever you want to call it, yeah.
Josephine Yen   2:23:49It's when when I'm dealing with bike stuff, I'd like 3 different, you know, people to tell me that it's what we can do. So, so thank you.Right.
Kelly Mattox   2:24:14Just those types of things. And so it would be on screen change, which is much better than file open, right?
Josephine Yen   2:24:14Right.Yep. What? What else, Kelly? What else keeps you up at night?
Kelly Mattox   2:24:22Yeah.Lots of things. Oh, no.
Josephine Yen   2:24:27Condition, conditioner related. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't. I don't want, I don't want that. Well, we don't have enough time for the the whole list.
Kelly Mattox   2:24:30Uh.No, I I mean that. I'm just worried about what you guys are putting in there that are different, I guess to think about what it is as long as you guys are putting in.Items within the condition itself and not moving into like changing a status because we have so much built around those status changes. We have hard stops, we have macros, we have all sorts of things based on statuses. So that would be the only other thing that would worry me from the condition portal.As long as you guys stick to just truly adding, signing off conditions and that's what it's used for and everything else is left for a later date, that's what I would say.
Josephine Yen   2:25:17Any change of status references on the portal will tell you open up byte status screen. Then it'll run. I think that's the fact that we're now that said, interestingly you guys are going to have to. So remember there are three use cases. There is invite, there is standalone and there is include.
Kelly Mattox   2:25:23Yeah.Yeah.Thank.
Josephine Yen   2:25:36Earlier, you guys are gonna solve for those last two 'cause you're not gonna have a bite screen. So does that mean that you can't change status? Oh, that means you can't. So yeah, it would be impossible to do it from those, but we could provide.Instruction for them to go, yeah, into. So we'll have to be on the day one. So we can't change it through the API 'cause we there's all these validation rules. We we check the API and yeah, it bypasses and so.
Kelly Mattox   2:26:05So there's more than that, Rusty. There's a whole underwriting screen. There's other screens that people complete things on that have to be completed. So if you're going to fire a hard stop based on calling a macro, you're also going to have to give them access to those fields. So it's almost like.
Josephine Yen   2:26:06-hGood.
Kelly Mattox   2:26:20We're almost giving them. They don't clear any of these things on a condition screen, right? They can't change a status. If the screen technically opens where it is, they do the same thing that they do today, which is on the right side. If they want to keep conditions open on the right side, they change their screen on the right side, which is their status screen and change their status.Status. It's all about training and educating people on how to use the system.
Josephine Yen   2:26:44I think, well, I think there's there's value short of changing status. There's still value in the tool being standalone. Like imagine I'm making it up, but like if it's in clear it can be mobile friendly so people can.Sign off on conditions while they're driving or at the park. Uh, while their spouse is driving. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Kelly Mattox   2:27:06It's probably not such a great idea, Mark. I'm kidding.
Josephine Yen   2:27:08Well, but they're in their Tesla, so you can hide it in the steering wall. But yeah, we'll need to account for like if I'm not in bite and I want to change the status, we probably want to disable that or give, like you said, an instruction that we don't support this. Please go to bite, do these things, blah.
Kelly Mattox   2:27:11Candy's probably not gonna like that one.
Josephine Yen   2:27:28Yeah, I think we'll still want to keep this button there because we still want them to add a note just to the communication challenges that exist. We want them to do that. Maybe. And again, I'm no, thank you. Thank you, Jody. Thank you.
Kelly Mattox   2:27:37I do have to go, guys. Sorry, I had plans this evening. Thank you. If you guys need me again, just ping me and I'll be happy to jump on.
Josephine Yen   2:27:44All good. Appreciate it. Bye bye. Like like phase three, maybe we could have a toaster pop in by that gets triggered by that. So you come here in the toaster pop.
Kelly Mattox   2:27:45Thank you. Bye.
Josephine Yen   2:27:59Says, oh, you have an outstanding thing. You need to go change the status or something. That way they're they when they go, even if they didn't know about it, they go to the loan. They can see it as a as a to do. It's a toaster pop like a like a little pop in the bottom right that tells you something. You know what I mean? Like we could we could say oh for this loan.Trigger a toaster pop in the queue. So when someone goes there and they see it, maybe they'll click it and then goes to change the status.Um.OK, what else? I'm like, I feel way better. I thought Kelly was gonna sabotage us. That was the problem. The whole thing. Yeah, it sounded like if we can do these roles. OK, so they ask for product guys. We need a Excel spreadsheet. We need all the roles. Yeah, and I need to know.I I wanna have like all the am I using? Am I using the term right? We need all the verbs of the things that either can like maybe we put we list out the 15 things that are that can be done and we just color code it like red or green. Oh yes or no for yes or no. You either can or can't do it and then and then we will create as many.The the lowest common denominator of roles necessary. It sounds like we have a loan officer. It sounds like we have a processor one, a processor 2, an underwriter one, an underwriter 2, a post closer and a funder. I I heard seven unique roles based off of what Kelly said.And underwriter.In fact, we need to do it based on a condition status and possibly the loan status. Does the. I don't even know if there's a difference between a loan and a processor one. Like I I in a in a in a cellular like all three of those are they not? Don't they all do the same thing? They can.Oh, I guess maybe an underwriter can't. That's fine. I'm sorry. A loan officer maybe cannot assign a doc to a condition. Maybe we don't want them to do that. Yeah. Anyway, we we just need to create a matrix. I can have like based on what we're talking about from this transcript, I can have Claude.Build that out. So I'm just gonna say if if it were me, like, hey Claude, let's build a let's build a a matrix. I wanna have 7 roles. I want a loan officer, a processor, 1A processor 2, an underwriter one, an underwriter 2.A funder and a closer, and I want to have a list of all of the actions that you can do in conditions portal that we talked about, like create a condition, link a document to a condition, update a status, add notes, exception handling, and then I want to.Understand which features can be done or not done per role. If we find any roles that are identical, we can collapse that to a single role unless we want it for aesthetics like maybe if an LO and an underwriter happen to be the same.I don't want them to have the same role. We'll separate them just because they're too far apart. Is that. Am I thinking about that right? Is that? Yes, I think so. Yep. And then we can tell engineers, forget about what Byte has, what Byte's doing.When the person logs in, we'll take their. So one more thing, we'll need to map it. So we will need to take the 300 rolls of of to the space roll that we talked about into our seven. Yeah, but once you're in your seven, when the conditions portal, we'll simply look at our own little mini version of what of the heat map, what we can do and not do. That way we can ignore.Everything else.Yeah. So and we'll need a bite person. That's a perfect job for our new employee. We'll have Andrew help us take all of the bite roles and merge them up into the groups of seven or eight or whatever we decide.And who's gonna sign off on this? Lauren. Lauren. She's gonna fill it up, fill it in and and or we'll we'll we'll attempt it like maybe we start and we we do what we think makes sense. Like Toni, maybe we can. I know you're part of your your parting gift maybe could be to help us understand the at least the roles, right. Like what do you think?Think and then and then we'll have Lauren eyeball it and then it'll change, but at least we can, yeah, we can start there.We got the database figured out OK.Who's burnt out from conditions? I'm gonna raise my hand. I'm like, I'm like, just getting. I'm just, I'm getting excited about it. I'm like, yes, where's the whiteboard?Kitt's gonna come by in like an hour. Do you guys wanna just break? And I was gonna try and check into my hotel. Yeah, maybe get caught up and and maybe. So I wanted to the the we need to be there at six. Is everyone good for the escape room? Is everyone good? Yeah. OK, so it's at 6:40. I thought we would leave here.Here by like 6:15, because we have everyone has to sign a waiver. OK, because if you get stuck in the cage, there's a kid. Yeah, there's yeah, it's actually kind of kind of freaky.Cotifying case of Is it for the part where you stick your hand in the dark hole and does everyone have to go win or just one person do what the whatever you can get stuck in. So Toni's Toni's never done. Have you who's who's not done an escape room?There's a lot of fun, but Toni hadn't done one before, so I was scaring her a little bit. I'm going to fall. Well, I I was stuck in an elevator for hours. Yeah, yes, by yourself or like 20 minutes. No, my husband and I were the only ones stuck in an elevator.There for about 6 hours. Oh my gosh. God. So yeah, no, but I couldn't pee. That's the problem. Wow. That's a that's a really. No, that was a it's. It was very painful. It was very painful.But took them so long.I think they had a power outage. Oh, a power blip in that one moment. But every everybody recovered. But the elevator, our elevator. No, we were like on the third floor. But what was nice about it? It's not like enclosed.So part of it was glass. You could see us. So I couldn't go to the bathroom. Oh, even if I wanted to. I could turn. You 'cause you could see it. There was the whole it was the Hilton in the Anaheim, actually the the hotel, the elevators in the lobby. Well, anyways, and.It's anyone staying at the home? Yeah, but it's it's in the lobby, so you can see the whole lobby going down. It's like the whole center. I know. And then all the rooms were like around the whole lobby going all the way up, all the way up.Yeah, they gave us a voucher to go back. I I'm good.Good. So, yeah, that was a long time, yeah.So didn't you say I? He said 6:30. We're gonna leave from here. So we're breaking still.So, oh, wait, it's gonna be here at five. Yeah. Hey, Carlos, do you wanna stay on or?
Carlos Sanchez   2:35:35Are you guys still going over anything else or I'm I'm actually I'm crashing right now. I'm I'm gonna probably.
Josephine Yen   2:35:35Sure.Yeah, why don't you rest? Rest up.
Carlos Sanchez   2:35:44Go to sleep.
Josephine Yen   2:35:46Yeah, uh, good for you. All right, take it easy. I'm gonna hang up now.
Carlos Sanchez   2:35:47All right, well.
Leslie Chang stopped transcription
