Conditions Portal offsite-20260113_090122-Meeting RecordingJanuary 13, 2026, 5:01PM2h 37m 5sLeslie Chang started transcription   3:35Hi, Carlos.Carlos Sanchez   3:38Hey, Mark, I was gonna say if you guys have started, I I can't hear you.Leslie Chang   3:41Oh, not not yet. We were just sitting ready. Situated. Hi. Nice to see you again. So this is the team. I don't know who you've got. I can't introduce cause I don't know who knows who. So I'll leave that to you guys. I'm Leslie. Hi. Nice to meet you.Carlos Sanchez   3:50No worries.Leslie Chang   3:58Hey, Rusty. Yeah, Bruh, you can have that share if you want. Let me record. So yeah, we're gonna start recording.Um, oh, no, it's already OK.Carlos Sanchez   4:19You guys are recording already. Oh.Leslie Chang   4:20We need that. I'm going to start recording my little, my little dude here. OK, OK, so.Carlos Sanchez   4:25Oh.Leslie Chang   4:29Thank you everybody for being here. Thank you. A special thank you for all the people that that flew out. I appreciate everyone's time. So I'm going to spend about 15 minutes and just give kind of an introduction and and like talk to you guys about.A little bit about conditions portal and a little bit about this session, but at the end of the day, please treat this as a as a kind of a working session. I know we don't always get to get together often, so just a couple of housekeeping items. Bathrooms right outside. There's a.There's a a little coffee nook downstairs. If you want to get some food, we'll be having a noon across the street. Wood Ranch Grill, if you're interested, that'll be at noon. So we'll probably leave about 15 minutes walk across the street.And then we have a I have room for eight. We have an escape room at 6:30, 6:20 tonight, also across the street. So I have 640. Is it 620? 640. That's what you said in your invite. Whatever. Yeah, whatever my invite said. I think. I think we had a little bit of time to to get there to to catch up.And then afterwards, if you guys want to meet up for dinner or something, that's, you know, fine. Tomorrow we'll try to end around 3:00 for those who are traveling. And I think that's it. So I think the overall agenda today, the goal was just kind of a repeat of what we we talked about on Friday today.We want to Leslie was kind enough to make a kind of an agenda here. It's all about the requirements. I I want you guys to all leave here being experts at conditions portal. So why did it come about? What are the features? Who are the users? What are the what are the functions?What are we going to do? And then what features are we maybe not going to do? So I want to kind of create a division of phase one, phase two. Tomorrow we're going to talk about implementation strategy.Engineers, thank you for being here. This is helpful because it will help product understand like what you guys need and and what we're supposed to be building and what you guys ultimately are looking for because this will all be done with cloud code on both sides. This will be very different. So I do not want people writing requirements and I I I'm I'm.I'm going to speak on behalf of Rusty and Kitt. Rusty, correct me or I'm wrong. We do not want engineers writing code. We want everyone using Cloud and the the sorry that's hovering behind you. The the mechanism between product and engineering will be GitHub so.Product people will use Cloud Code to submit their tickets and their issues and their acceptance criteria in the GitHub and then the engineers will pull those tickets and they will write the code and then they will pass the criteria and pass it back.We have a guest speaker tomorrow, Sato or Saro, who will who's written this tool that will help us do those things. So we'll be able to use Cloud Code and do a slash new feature or bug or whatever and it will help us build out those requirements.And it will also help engineering pull those items and we'll be able to discuss technical components like oh, product has a POC, a proof of concept. Where does that go? What do we do if we have like a data model? Like I know Josephine has a nice Excel spreadsheet that has the data model of conditions and all of the.Idiosyncrasies of that is product telling engineering how to design the database. No product is telling engineering these are the components or features that we believe are important and engineering can do kind of what they want with that. So so that again that'll be kind of tomorrow's.Uh topic. Uh questions.I have an unrevated question. Yes, sure. It is roaming the world, capital R, all one word. We're the second group of people working on the STLC alpha that's working on, yes, so.Kitt has been working with him and Rich and Chase have been working to like make sure that it's up to snuff. Who from the product side has been working with him. So we've been doing a little hidden project with Emily. So Emily and Andy have been working with Sato to you do the.So you guys are familiar with the Libre chat, you know the the GPT for the loan officers where in in February Paul and I are we have 90 minutes on stage in front of like 900 people to talk about AI, which is gonna be stressful.And salespeople, right? Yeah, Yeah. And we're going to reveal our landing page, which is going to have like talking heads of all of our Libra chats. But it's more than that. It's going to be the tool that like Leslie's POC team and and various engineers and product people as we build things and we want to like.Test them out or or have like a a a marketplace. It's going to be a place to where you can publish our tools and have a little landing page and you can have a little avatar that like hey my product is amazing and check it out. So that's what we're revealing. But yes, we're using Samus tool for that to to kind of get the.The kinks worked out. I wanted to use his tool for this project because this is a conditions portal is probably like top three largest initiatives for 2026. This is a super big deal. This is a cutting edge project.Um, I'm excited about it and and you guys should all be super nervous. Uh, just kidding. Oh good, you guys. And if you guys, anybody like you know, half of you are product, half are engineering if you need any cloud assistance.I will spend an unlimited amount of my own time sitting with you and working with you on whatever you need with Claude, so feel free to use that if you need it. OK, housekeeping over.Did I miss anything? No. So today, this morning, um, what I thought we would do. Uh, let me talk. I'm gonna. I'm gonna do introduction to to conditions portal. Leslie's gonna go up, and she's going to show you aIs it Cloud code or bolt? Bolt. A bolt generated proof of concept. This will be our working prototype that we will deliver to engineering, so it will contain all of the features and the functionality.But it will all be pseudo fake, right? Fake data. It's not actually connected by not connected to clear. Later Tim and and the combination of Tim and Josephine and Toni, we will walk through.Any ancillary features that we want to add through Figma. I think Tim, you could probably do kind of your one hour walking through all of the idiosyncrasies of how you do things with docs when we're and and what we want to do is we I want engineering to kind of either observe or opine on the features.And kind of decide, OK, we think this is in or out and we'll talk more about deadlines later. But the the really what I want to figure out is like what do we think is a good use case for version 1.0 and I'm going to be more aggressive than I would normally be since we have a cloud, I'm going to argue.Everything is in unless we have a a compelling reason not to do it like oh it has some other dependency that we can't do or but the answer shouldn't be oh because it's a lot of dev work because or BSA work because it shouldn't be because we have a lot. So that's kind of our that's like my mindset and it's up to you guys to change the mind if.Do you think that that's out of out of risk because we're ramping up, I want to make sure that we understand like priorities and things that are dependent, right. So if there's like if there's something that is high priority that has like a lower priority dependency, that jumps up in priority 100%, that's totally fine. So we know what to work on in order. Yep.Can I know you're flexible towards the end right about like what what necessarily doesn't. I'm not gonna give any dates, but what I'll ask products when we're done here, I would ask product to provide a working prototype and full cloud requirements by the end of this month.I think that that's reasonable using Sato's tool and our full prototype. And if you guys come back and say that's not possible, we need it until mid February, that's fine. But I'm just, I'm setting some general timelines so that we can get this kind of where it needs to be because that if your stomach's dropped a little bit, that's totally reasonable.Uh, yes. Two questions listening. I just, uh would ask if you could help expedite cloud code for me. I don't have it on my uh company laptop. OK, I saw that you put the request in. I did. Yeah, yeah. Uh.Thanks, Josephine. You want to share with the class? Just kidding. Yeah, we'll get anybody who doesn't. Anybody who doesn't have Claude. I know Tim does not yet, but if you don't have it, we'll I'll help you expedite that. Annie.Can you give a quick explanation of Sato's tool? Yes, I've heard it, but I've never. So he will do a much better job tomorrow, but generally his tool is a is a plugin, so it's a it's a component that you install with plot.And I think I I I equate it to like a slash command. So you have this concept where you can do slash. So he'll first he'll create a repo. So we'll have him create a repo. It'll have all of the folders in it in GitHub for like tickets.The proof of concept, any requirements, any Figma, any data models, whatever we want to put, there'll be sort of a structure for all of that and then his tool will allow you to like slash new feature and it will interview the product person and say what is the feature? Oh, it's this and then it will ask you relevant questions.To build up kind of the the use case of of the description and then it will also it will it will be able to refer to things in that project in those resources folders to help create a more substantial request and then importantly it will also contain.Acceptance criteria and that's super important. So for the product people, the acceptance criteria is the QA pass if if the engineer should not pass it back to the product person unless all those acceptance criteria are met.The caveat is you can't just Willy nilly create an acceptance criteria that's like impossible. For example, if your acceptance criteria requires seeded data, like oh, you must do this and this with this loan, your acceptance criteria has to include markdown language of how to create the scenario.So that'll be where the rubber meets the road. All we we product cannot give unachievable criteria to engineering and product is responsible that all of the acceptance criteria is met if if engineering gives a thing back.And you push the button and it doesn't pop a window. But acceptance criteria didn't say that. That's a product problem. That's not an engineering problem. Josephine requires us to break it down into features. Yeah, I mean building modular, you know, building block one starts.I think do those on one. I think that's a discussion with you guys. Do you want to do you want to start with a project that says build the base grid and and landing screen and then you start adding features? Probably like like if if the features are dependent on other things existing you you guys can. What I don't want is I don't want one ticket.That is 40,000 lines of instruction. I I want it broken down in a in a feature way because I think that's just more consumable. And I mean, again, I'll have engineering applying. We'll do it together.But Sara will be here to help us with that tool and he'll demo it for us. Annie, the other goal of that, sorry, is to make it so that we we don't have to go on the GitHub at all. It's so that we're working through the command line. So all the all the little things that we have to do, like go update tickets, go.You know, no writing in, but like do code reviews and like talk in the in the comment section, that's all of the the tedious parts of the SDLC are.Otherwise, it's on the other side. OK. In case of part about this story just a little bit. So when we started talking about conditions portal like more than a year ago, there was a spreadsheet that Francesca started. Yes, that's 700 conditions, yeah.Is that part of the scope it it it will be part of so I consider it yes. So so let me describe the history of conditions portal. But to answer your questions, it is a prerequisite of the conditions portal going out. So what she what what Josephine's describing is the conditions portal.And it's base level is just a UI. It's a the the way that by our our LOS shows conditions today is is hot garbage. It's looks like 1980s. It's very the screens are convoluted. There's a bunch of.Data that's like some people use, some people don't. So what we're trying to really do is we're trying to revolutionize the interface and and why don't I just tell the introduction story. She's Leslie's already heard and it'll answer Josephine's question. So the the core conditions portal is to create a single.Place a portal for loan officers, processors, underwriters, funders. Those are kind of your four main roles. Now there's sub roles, there's processor one and two and three and all of that jazz, but it's it's to give one place for all employees to come to for a condition.Yes. So when you say funders, you mean like you mean like conditions on like tranches of loans that we're trying to sell? Well, no, because there's some, there's sometimes prior to funding conditions, PTF. So funders might at the funding level and and our resident mortgage experts Toni and Jina can can.Describe like scenarios where that exists. But yes, funders might need to either approve or or whatnot a a condition and I'll walk through all that at a high level and that will make the the demo make more sense. It did come up these scenario reviews with the post closing.Funding and so on departments that they do use conditions portal, but very similarly to.How how it's implemented today. So it's not like it would require a vast, right. The the use cases are the project right now to get their requirements into a completely separate thing. Find it. Yeah. So I think that's why I'm asking, right. There's a small oh, they're gonna be completely happening from condition.There's a small project to build what what's gonna be. Sorry, that's dicing. So if that's the case, yes. So typically your your.Your underwriters are the one. So. So what is a condition, right? A condition is I like to. I like to treat it like a JIRA ticket. A condition is like a ticket. Your your your underwriter is sort of your your QA person.And your processor is your engineer. So your underwriter creates a condition that your processor has to go and solve. And how do they solve it? Typically by attaching a document. So a condition. And again, I I apologize if I'm speaking to people who know this in and out.A condition typically is a request for a piece of documentation or information so that the loan can proceed. A condition itself is typically a. There are two types. There's kind of a well-known, so it's kind of call it a cookie cutter out-of-the-box.And and that's what Josephine was referring to. Bite has like 700 conditions that you can kind of pre-select anything from assets to income to employment to banks like it's a variety. So there it's it's kind of.It's it's sort of subcategorized. You can also create ad hoc conditions. So you might just say, you know what, I it's not quite what I want. I'm just going to manually type out what it is and all of those are are kind of valid. There is a separate project going on with Francesca.Where the 700 conditions are either duplicate or they're messy or some aren't being used or or maybe the wording is kind of off and there's a a project to kind of clean that up. So you say type out, do they do they tie it to any data or is it just like literally just description? It's it's ad hoc.So you can add a pocket. Your condition ID is like 0 because it's not. It's just kind of an ad hoc sentence like you're you're allowed to to. No, it's just like one sentence. No, it's not tied to load data. It's not tied to load data. It could be 1-2 census if you right, right concise. It's just right.Like the the manually. There's no like merge, there's no merge fields or anything. And and so like an interesting part of what Francesca's doing is go query. This is like a perfect cloud thing, right? Go query all of the custom.Conditions and see if there is our popular ones that maybe should be out-of-the-box, right? So there's we don't necessarily want custom conditions, but we don't want to stop it because we, you know, we can't. We need to let people get their jobs done.So the condition portal itself will solve a usability problem. It will it will keep everybody together and the goal of the tool is 1 to introduce.Streamline efficiencies too. It's kind of our way of like putting AI in the tool. There's this borrower needs list that we deploy. I'll talk about in a minute that kind of helped us get a little bit out the door and and ultimately the the real goal is and you'll see this in some of the demos.If I'm a processor or a loan officer or an underwriter or a funder and I come to the tool like I'm on my iPhone at a glance, I should have a badge with a number that tells me like things I have to do. So if I am an underwriter, I should see.The little red 12, I have 12 conditions to to review and I'm going to go and I'm going to look at those and I'm going to pass them or fail them or create new conditions. If I am a processor and I have eight things to do, these are conditions I need to satisfy and I'm going to go and I'm going to do those.But it's it's think of it like a wizard, right? I should be able to hit next, next, next. As I get as I get documentation back, I should have a queue for that. So everything that you see is going to be around kind of queues so that it's at a sure I can zoom in and I can look at the grid and I can solve a condition but.What I'm really after is the ability to kind of come in, knock out my outstanding queue items and then and then kind of move on.Jake. Hi. How are you doing, Sir? Sorry to interrupt. No, you're all good. Thank you. This is our gracious host, Jake. Thank you. This is part of our product team. We're doing condition loan conditions. Got it. OK, well, I will leave you guys to it. You won't even know I'm here.I told them to periodically, like, steal stuff out of your office and bug you, so hope that's OK. Well, there's not much here. We're gonna bang the gong a few times too.Um, so.For what? So conditions are so. So again, you're gonna be going through these queues, right? And.Phase two, not phase one. Once we know like all of the actions for a condition or for a loan, imagine that we zoom out and say, all right, I'm not today, phase one, we're going to be inside the loan.Right. But just so you're aware of kind of where we're going with things, if we were to zoom out and say, I don't want to look at the loan, I want to look at the pipeline and instead of looking at one loan and the various actions, I want to look at my pipeline and I've got.300 loans and I want to group them or sort them by outstanding actions and I might be able to do interesting things like oh, it's end of month and I want to see how many items I can knock out before the end of the month right before our funding day closes. Let me let me sort by least amount of.Work and I can go open those loans and I can say, OK, knock out this, knock out this, as opposed to working on like a problem file that's got 35 open issues. Today they don't have that visibility. They have to open a loan, they have to look at it. It's a pain in the ***. So we can start creating like reports and and almost get to the point where maybe we can create.Actionable process of like what tickets should you work on? Or maybe a step further as a underwriting manager, how can I distribute loans to my team? Like if I have a junior underwriter, let let's give that person like the easier work and give the tougher stuff to somebody else like we have.New.And new data things that we can do. So it's not just making it streamlined, but it's having that data available so that we can manage and organize it better. Jina, your condition IDs, are you going to be redoing all of them? I would say you're gonna redo your conditions and your condition IDs to make them meaningful. Like a lot of conditions you'll see are like 1003 is just condition 582.It it will depend on the complexity and if I have to change data, do I have to go back and change the historic or is there a way to like like I don't want to have any orphaned records. So TPD I think we'll.Link OK, it's just a template. OK, condition ID so much but like so when I was at Candid what we created were smartphones for conditions because it helps you activate data so you can people prescripted for how you strategize your business. What bars are really profile of our personas, right? So if you have.If you see that your one condition for your conditions can go ahead and pull a story of, hey, we're always running to this one condition for this loan product that we sell to X investor. Maybe you go to that X investor and say, hey, we're seeing this frequently. Can we go and compensate it a different way because this works that was crying at the client rate because of that one condition that's right.To that program, it just helps you kind of data model a bit in regards to how your programs are applicable to your borrower, adjustable market and how that's coming through and then what our percentage are not coming to the table as much around the condition. It kind of flows together because your conditions are around either credit profile borrower.So that helps you aggregate in regards to what the solutions are fired for. That's why I asked about the 700. The plan over a year ago was to be able to concatenate data and bring it in, put it into a rules agenda, not make it be manual.And Kelly Maddox wanted to always run it every time to stay on the loan, keep on reevaluating. That's what I was asking, which is kind of our borrowers needs list a little bit, but just but yes, short answer, we're going to do that. But to the depth we will determine what I don't want is I don't want a data cleanup project to stall this one too much so.So if we get halfway there or we'll figure out common sense, I guess I don't have a good answer other than we'll look at it and and I intentionally have a different team working on that so that this team doesn't get distracted. And you can also you can categorize based stuff if it's been an AUS condition that's firing, right?And AUS is per LPA is referred to you? Is it an overlay? Is it investor required? Is the CMG specific right? Is it cash out is tight to tight to assets, etcetera. Like it shouldn't be really extensive, but you can do numerations and.Things like that in regards to what that it's like a barcode. So thank you. That brings us to OK, so that's condition. Any questions about conditions portal, that's a general use case and we're going to get a demo.And we're going to walk you guys. Again, you guys will be experts like by lunchtime. Let's talk about how we got to today. So about a year ago, conditions portal became a thing because certain people in this room worked at other companies where we developed it seemed to successful. So we wanted to do.But again, challenge was it got really big and it's it's everybody's fault including mine. But we we made it just this monstrous project that was it. We had a really hard time getting buy in with the business. Everybody had their opinion.Operations at CMG has been is lackluster at best as as far as like management style because we have like 4 managers who all have opinions. They're not wrong, but they're different. What's kind of revitalized this project is one we can use cloud, we can knock it out quicker.Two, Susan Walker was promoted to Chief Production Officer. She thought it was COO. Sorry, CO. Why? Why do I keep wanting to say production officer? I'm like, she's from COO is the title you're getting for. Chief Brockoff. No, I want to. No, I want that.I I so there's this concept of like you if you don't want there's there's a Goldilocks zone. You don't want to get too close to the sun. Like I learned out of like there's a comfort zone but if you get too close then all of a sudden the the the pay isn't worth the the the skill set.Paul, go to those meetings. Yeah, exactly. Or is Paul the son? He's he's for me. So, so I forgot what I'll say now.Oh, yes, thank you. Thank you. So with Susan now in charge of operations, she has put a lady, Lauren, in charge of like kind of wrangling everybody in operations.So we will be giving Lauren will be one of our partners. In addition we have Theresa and a few others. We have the key is we now have stronger partnerships with the business who who are are more focused on what we need. And so I I think now we have a much better chance. So this is kind of a second.Ask at this, but we get the advantage of all of the folks that have already been here and have built some of this. We're we're we're kind of hitting the ground running and I I hope with Claude and and with all these tools and the new people we this and the point of this meeting was just to get everybody focused so we could kind of knock out the project which again I believe will be.The, you know, one of the, if not the biggest impact projects for 2026. So between a little bit last year and now without cloud, we had this conundrum. How do we keep people interested while we figure things out? How do we slowly release bases?And and hence was born the borrower needs list, which I think Josephine had kind of a big role and Toni as well. So the goal of the borrowers and and this will get into the Candor discussion. So you have the conditions portal over here well.Borrower needs list was a mechanism earlier on in sales that says we have a rules engine that will look at the conditions of the that's a bad word. Look at the criteria of the loan and say, oh, this is an FHA, it's in New York and it's XYZ and this person has $300,000.Flyers down payment, whatever you need the following doc types and those become requests for borrower needs list like a list of docs the borrower needs. And then we implemented an AI tool that would actually not only.Read that condition list and mail merge it, but also make it like very friendly so that it's always unique. So the borrower gets a super nice e-mail. Hey Mr. Smith, thanks for reaching out. I just want to let you know how amazing this is going to be and and and in order to get started you're going to need the following documents.Bank statement from B of AX4432 with a balance of $50,000. Please send me that. So it's very specific and very nuanced using AI. That is a tool that's actually in the conditions portal is like a.Button like request docs from borrower, but we started building some of these features ahead of time, preconditions portal just so we could. I wanted to test out the AI and and the borrower needs list and all that good stuff. So there's a few components that are already there that we're going to kind of.Wire in. So for the engineers and and I just product to product will need to make sure that we reference stuff that's already there. I'm not saying we replaced borrow these lists, but we might to it when you click this button. So we'll talk about those features kind of when we get there.And then finally, I know I'm talking a lot. I'm sorry. Finally, the conditions portal is going to be built in clear, but we don't have any operation people in clear. So how do we solve that?So Clear has a technology where you can open a web browser. It is a clear. I'm sorry, it is a let me start over.Bite all of our our operations people are in bite. We are not in clear, but we want to build this tool clear. So I'd like the tool to be able to be open with a link like CMG dot conditions so I can open it like we do with clear docs. It can be open from clear in the menu.Or if you go into Byte, you're going to be able to open a web control and Byte has the ability to pass like the current loan number. And we can also do things like we can save the loan, we can pull data from that open loan. This already all exists. We do this with our pipeline and we do it with our clear docs tool. So there is and and Rusty can help.Defer where needed, but we do have the ability to have kind of a smart window inside of Byte. So we will be having our users open Byte, open that clear window and do all of their work and when they close or save it'll it'll go save that data. So it'll feel seamless, but it will be a modern look and feel.So what we see here will apply to clear and bite.I'm not sure if we're ever gonna have processors or back office folks completely unclear. I don't know that that's. I mean, if we're eventually gonna eat away at it, right? Like every new feature, we're not gonna build things in byte. We're gonna build a clear screen and pop it in byte. So I'll I'll kinda eat it from the inside, if you will, maybe one day.It won't be in there anymore. Sure. I mean, when cloud gets strong enough, I'm going to, I'm just going to say take this source code and convert it all to web and be done. Like that should take six months from now. So yeah, I just take the DLLS. Yeah, we're in preschool with the cloud right now. Like, wait, wait till we're.We're in like 6th grade. I can't wait. I'm extremely excited about clouds, so sorry, we couldn't tell. So the last thing you have conditions portal. You can certainly manually create conditions.And approved conditions and all of that, right? There's a whole flow which will demo. I mentioned borrowers needs list. So outside of the conditions portal, the borrower borrower needs list can be launched and it's it's output is a list of open conditions and it's smart enough to know duplicates or stuff that's already open.Or whatever. But anything the borrower needs list creates will show up as a condition. Caveat. It does not today. Right now it's just a doc request not to be confused with a condition. So borrower's needs list will need to be enhanced to to create the conditions.There is a separate parallel engine called Candor, which is part of the reason that Jina Choi is here. We are launching Candor today. So in a nutshell and and I encourage you guys to get a demo from.Jina Choi and then, hey Carlos, are you, are you alive or can you hear us?Carlos Sanchez   37:55I can hear you. Yep.Leslie Chang   37:56Sweet. Carlos will be Jina Choi's conduit at at CMG for Candor. So as Carlos gets up to speed, we'll have Jina Choi and Carlos's Candor experts in a nutshell from a conditions.Oral perspective, Candor will read the AUS results and it will create conditions that Candor will be responsible for signing off on through OCR and other things. So it's almost like a they call it like a almost like a.A private or a mock underwriter is doing all of the work as documents get uploaded. Let's say Candor creates a condition that says you need bank statements and those statements, the processor still has to go out and find those and get those right. But once they're there, Candor will.Automatically read the bank statement and say, oh, this satisfies, sign off on this condition and then the underwriter doesn't have to do anything. The underwriter just has to focus on the borrower needs list conditions, which should be an overlay of stuff Candor is not aware of or anything that was manually added by the underwriter. Jina Choi, did I say that correctly?level. Yeah, I love that back there. There's There's a limited set of documents that Candra can read today, and then, based off of that, whatever I can't read, then I'm right. It would add the So, for example, there's divorce decree in there, and there's child support, and the condition for child support agreement, etc.that I'm working with Andrew this is going to go into a little bit of a tail. We've been talking to Andrew with access. So the more that we can translate the documents from Pdf to Jason for candid and just the cheaper it is for us.Their highest expense on their side is the OCR capabilities. If we strip that, our costs get reduced by and that's a significant cost too. And we have this cool thing called Gemini Flash. So it costs us like fractions of a cent on the dollar per page, so.Will this is this is out of scope but will this like maybe this is more for Tony as we work Tony who now by the way owns CMG docs. So docs is a close sibling nephew of of conditions portal they will be.Docs is think of docs like the list of docs conditions as the conditions, but they kind of like reference each other. Inside docs you can see conditions. Inside conditions you can see docs there. It's effectively a like which parent do you want to look at so.Um, as we do more things with doc congestion, uh, like to Jina Choi's point, can we use Gemini and all these tools to to do things with docs?OK. That's the overview. Sorry, I went a little longer. I figure we can do about an hour. I don't know how long you need, but the hope would be we do your review Tim's deep dive and then we'll go to lunch and then we can come back and then we'll kind of have an open discussion and let's.Let's ask questions and find over features and and Josephine, I know you you have like a ton of like data modeling questions. So let's let's maybe start talking about those. Is that a fair direction for the for the day? Yeah. Any other questions based off what I said?And I'm not right. I'm just everything I'm saying is my opinion. So I want you guys to opine and and correct or or if you have, if you have opinion or strong opinions, please speak up. We want to make sure everybody's comfortable. So the first phase we're working on is to stay in the fight.I think, I think, yeah, well, phase one will be all three. I want to be able to link it directly through clear and through bite. So I think we would build the core clear website and then there would be maybe breakouts that say, oh, I want to, I want to access it these three ways and.And clear docs and our opportunities, I mean our our processor pipelines have that model today. So we have, we do have clear screens that open and bite so we can and I'll defer to Rusty, but we can like use that pattern to to to create these things.Another thing, probably on the engineering side as we go through this, there are things that we identified when we're going through the plan that will require in order to get the efficiency we wanted some modifications to the existing data model that Bite has.That at least previously we've talked about putting into EPS and having that become essentially the source of truth for conditions. So we'll probably call those out and go through, but they're called was 4 horsemen, but yeah, by the 5th. So now it's five horsemen and we're not seeing that anymore.Yeah, somebody got in trouble. Oh, is it? Was someone offended? Yes. Oh, because it's considered like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Oh, which is extremely accurate.Well, well, we we can now save Lauren because she's our single point. Yeah, for our operations, OK, we don't have to deal with all the teams. We can certainly have conversations, but Lauren will be kind of our, I guess our tie breaker.OK. Which is good because we've never had that before. So I just wanted to call that out for our engineering folks because everything that will have a big impact on on scope and stuff.OK.All right. That said, with I'll hand it over to Leslie with with Bolt, we have this awesome opportunity to actually show like working stuff and not just. I know we're going to do Figma as well, but we we can now at least show off like what we think is kind of a first glance and to the engineers.This is an interesting artifact, right? So we're going to be giving you a proof of concept source code, this thing, and I don't know to what degree we're going to reference this and you you can certainly take this as a starting point or you can start from scratch. This is.Means to tell a story. It is not meant to describe how to build the technology. So it's kind of a learning curve for all of us. So along the way like like like ask your questions as you see this. But I I think you know this this is meant to give you like a 90% of the way there in a visual.And and you'll have access to this source in the project along with all the retirements. But yeah, anyways that that's kinda like one of the the big above and beyond that that that we'll get with with AI is is kind of a a story and this.We have gone through extensive user testing, so the use cases here are fairly solid, but you know, like we'll likely have to do like another Lauren review like before we as we get further. Anyway, I'll stop talking. I think it would be neat because we did like.Prototype testing, right? That's so much more limited than what we can do. Well, what my goal would be, I'd like, I'd like the what I I'll ask kind of maybe if product and Leslie is when we leave here, we'll have a list of all the Figma stuff. We'll add that to the prototype. I want the prototype to be as close as possible, call it 90%.Of behavioral to what we all agree to so that we can all have a call it a source of truth. We can go back here and say, you know, I'm not, I don't care at all. It's this font or this color. I just want to make sure that the functionality is there. OK, Leslie. Yeah. So I I want to start. This is actually Tim's bolt prototype. I built mine.In October and Mark, you'll like this. I think Opus came out four or five came out in what, December? December, yeah. So they got way more sophisticated about ingesting the Figma designs and files. So I think from a design perspective, this is not exactly the same as the Figma, which Tim and Josephine are going to walk.The team through later today, but this gets really, really close and you'll see I might have to toggle back to my prototype because I think there may be gaps in functionality. So then you may see mine, but this is I'm so impressed by Opus 4/5. It's just.Like I used MCP. I like, you know, copy code into Bolt, but Tim's prototype is so much better with Opus, so so I'll be demoing his. Anything else? Oh yeah.Carlos Sanchez   46:46Leslie, is there be able to share it or to do that, but I'd rather be there but.Leslie Chang   46:51Oh, yes, yes. Sorry. Yep. Thank you.We wanted you here to make us sick, Carlos, right?Carlos Sanchez   46:56Uh.I don't. Yeah, I don't want to give you guys the the flu.Leslie Chang   47:02We appreciate that.OK, so this is thought right. I was using, yeah, with a different model with, yeah, because you can select the models. So I just started building conditions for all of this, see what I'm doing. It's made a huge difference. I mean, well, it's.It should be remarkable. Yeah, I'll show you mine really quick. It's all gonna keep doing that like every every time they release a new model, it should, you know, there's gonna be differences in levels, but like they're now there getting to train on on the data that.That like they're getting from people doing people using it, right. So every time it's gonna keep getting better. And this is just that's like the first like major step of like, oh, people have been using Sonic. Yeah, like it's the most popular model right now. I mean, it's been able to use all that training data and make it that much better. How much better it's gonna be? It's like.It's it's strange to grace that I mean, like not only does it get the UI better, it has less like development errors. Yeah. So I'm not, you know, I was battling errors. I was just able to churn through this pretty pretty quickly. I was like the speed. Everyone's doing it full time. It's like an hour or two a day.Sell your Figma stock. Sorry. Buy anthropic. Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, so.The biggest thing? Yeah, they're actually like printing them instead of starting everything. They can't try to get the right graphics card. Yeah, yeah. And then Apple decided not to make a model and just use Gemini. Did you hear about that? Yeah, last like yesterday. Yeah. So I think that's also good. It makes sense.For two reasons. They already know Google's a competitor and they don't want Open AI to be empowered because they're going to build their own devices. I think Open AI is going down. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, it'll be interesting. Yeah. So this is mine. This is the one I built in October. And this is Tim's, which.Once you see the Figmas, this is so much closer to the Figma and to your point, Tim, it's much easier to build those individual components. I found it super challenging with mine way back in October, which is like dog years for these technologies. So yeah, I'll be walking through.Tim, so I apologize if I stumble a little. I may defer to Tim a little bit. What was I going to say? OK, so this is the landing page. We have assumed the status is file received and Carlos, are you able to see OK?Carlos Sanchez   49:37Yeah. Thank you.Leslie Chang   49:38OK, perfect. So file received and then we also have the role here, processor and underwriter and this is posted on both sites, so you can access it via the URL if you want to play with it on your own time.So we're on the landing page and as Mark mentioned, we have the rules engine. So it's looking at the individual attributes of the loan and deciding what loan conditions need to be assigned to it. So these are grouped by you can see.Prior to docs, prior to funding, there's also prior to closing, suspended post funding. I don't know all of them off the top of my head, but there's several stage categories, so you can see the loan condition ID when it.Was added. There's a title of the condition, the description borrower versus INT. So that's is it a borrower condition or is it an internal condition? So is it something that we have to e-mail the borrower for or is it something like that can be fulfilled by?A title company or the appraisal company or a third party that would be considered internal or int. So and then there's also the concept of class and this is who can sign off on it. So you'll see processor or three underwriter and that's another thing they're closed cleaning up as part of the conditions.Project as I understand it, there's a lot of like weird PTD and other stuff that there that's grandfathered in from bite that that's going to go away. Also responsibility is going away most likely. That's what Kelly told us. Josephine, Tim and I met with Kelly.Right, you said they're gonna use it differently. It's only gonna be for post closing, so.You Candor uses that though for oh, that's so that'll be a take away. OK, let's like I don't think I think I think Candor is going to say Candor is responsible. We're using transaction that's invite that's not being used. So OK.OK. Yeah, that wasn't on my radar, so we can talk.Yes, we don't have to create a customer to use that number, nothing to stop and then you would. So you want that both in addition to the class. So it's either candor transaction, is that what you're trying to do?So no, that's a so that's what's being used because we're in a pilot base, so little much changes needed. Yeah. Transaction coordinators rule that insist in byte that's not being used. Yeah. So that folks know, hey, this is a camera condition that can be cleared. If I upload documents to satisfy this condition, I can write.Would that be in replacement out of like let's say underwriter or processor? It's an addition. That's what I think. So you would want both fields. You would want. I want to add class. What's your what's your? We need both fields. Well, so today you have a class. What they're the goal at least is Kelly described its class has been.To be used to find who can sign off the condition, right? We're getting rid of responsibility. I think what you're saying is you still want class, but you also want responsibility. Well, what can you use? Can you use class and go to Canberra if we were to add that? Everything class has a transaction.Well, I think you're gonna do that after, but now we just can we customize 'cause class is customized to us, so we could add class equal to candlework. I'd have to see if the class is in the response that they can actually personally make that change for. But let's table this as a as a take away. Why is this change going into?I thought it was gonna match January. They're sorry. They're making this change in January. It's the fight team. Yeah. Yeah. Do they? Do they know? I don't think they. I don't. I don't think they do. Who's it by? Like Kelly? Kelly. Kelly told us. OK, Kelly, we need to talk to them.And you're talking about byte software, right? Not byte there. We customize the job. No, she's saying Kelly, our Artica, Kelly Mattox. OK, that's a take away. We'll we'll need to talk to to Kelly. But the definition of class is who signed they're they're getting very prescriptive on the definition, right? Yeah.Lessons. They they may have forgot about the the Candor. We don't wanna kill our Candor. Yeah. Pilot the day it starts. We just met with her. Was it Friday? Yeah. Responsibilities. Responsibility. Yeah. Yeah.So after, yeah, based on our conversation, we removed responsibility and so you have filters up at the top. So active, cleared, ready for underwriting and active means different or is different depending on what role you're in. Right now I'm in the process or role.If you I'm in the underwriting role, you could potentially see different loans that are considered active for that role. And correct me if I'm wrong, Mark, but for phase one, it's only gonna be processor 3 and underwriter that we're gonna support. Or is that what we're here to find out today? I think we're here to determine that. OK, it would be.It would be great if we could include as many roles as possible, but let's let's. I need to know a little bit more about like what those roles are and ultimately it's also the business. What? What do they want to start with? But yeah, I think for now the two you have is good. OK, yeah, right now.Our prototypes only have processor 3. I like like someone said earlier, if we were to add funder or whatever, I don't know that the it's just changing options in the in the features. So I I think it's, I think it's minor if like oh a funder is very close to a underwriter as far as action. So if it's.If it's very close, it might be a low effort to add another one. I just don't know. All right, 'cause we had the permissions meeting with um, yes, um permissions is gonna be a challenge. It's gonna be very challenging to add a no. OK, we can talk about the details. I I I feel like permissions though, especially in the RF 5, will be more about.Just knowing what people can and cannot edit, I would think, at least from the implementation records, it's millions of records. I'm gonna go with the don't care. I like do everything and so not do like I think. I think we can.And Kelly is can you just clean this up? I don't want to depend on archaic data sets that are like. I don't want that to be a dependency if it's not working, you know what I mean? Yeah, again, we'll that'll be a take away.OK, so we have app ID condition description and you can also edit the individual conditions. In case you missed that, there's a little bit of a hover button next to the description and also you can click on the ID and there's also a flag for each condition that says whether.Or not. It's editable and so the the the edit functionality only applies to the description, right? It's not the condition is created and it's defined in the template of the condition.Yes. So we have the condition category, condition number. There's also condition status, so it can be new need bar request and that should that should be dependent on whether or not it's bar or internal though I thought. I thought if it's an internal condition, we don't have the need bar request. Yeah, setting that flag down below.Status is left in that drop down. So if you go back into it, you'll see the below the condition status. There's the maybe we would want to move that up for that reason, but you have the internal borrower chase on there. So my but my understanding though if it's internal and the condition.And status should not include need bar request, but OK, yeah, so that so that, yeah, just assume that the other thing about that too, the status. So this is one of those five things, right? Yeah, is this is where we deviate from the data model.By I think we added some statuses and we renamed and we renamed them so that they made more sense to somebody as they're going through it. Because right now it means won't really add up. So status is just double check.So, so just be one of the statuses and we use them to drive workflow. That's why they're important. We're trying to automate things as Mark pointed out. These statuses are a big driver of that workflow.So just rewind a little bit. The reason why this screen is filled up is the plan is that these those 700 conditions that we talked about, they kind of run through the rules engine and they're automatically created as a list for people to work on. That's the thought process. That's why the screen is not empty. It's filled in and then this is that new.Right. And we do it in stages so that, hey, we don't want the processor to see certain underwriter conditions. They're just going to see the ones that the processor would be able to see when they first get the file from the loan officer. So this is a subset of an automated condition run that will then run again after the processor finishes their job.So so that drop down in the top left corner that says active. So Oh yeah, yeah, so by role there's different options in that drop down. By role it does a filter under superset of list of conditions and it filters it.Specific to that person's view, underwriter or whatnot.OK, condition status and then we have stage PTDPTFPTP, post trailing and suspended. So these if there were a condition with a post, you would see it on the home screen under that specific stage. Right now we only have PTD and PTF.And then class, as I mentioned earlier, this is who can sign off on that condition. And then we have internal or bar. As I mentioned earlier, a bar is something like a driver's license or like I don't know AW2, whereas internal is something that we would fulfill from likely a third party vendor.And then you can set a flag and you can. Are we still doing colors? I thought we were only doing. There are colors in five. Yeah, I I don't know. Have the word. We might back and forth on this. So OK, yeah, I don't know where we landed.Yeah, OK, like like is their words, but their words that correspond to colors, I think. But we did. One thing that we changed between here and byte is byte byte is global, right? And the reason they they use the flag in byte is because there's no clear way to communicate to one another a change.On the condition. So we have fixed that with the way that we do notes. It's much more transparent. They don't have to open up a condition to see what's going on. They get clear notification of any kind of key change or note that's been added. So flags and in this case are now user specific. They're not.They're not global. It's morbid users call out, hey, I need to come back to this. They can put a color. That color can mean anything they want it to. There's no like, so so just saying no. Sorry. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Just so structure wise, yellow bone.Alone has many conditions. A condition has many many notes. A condition has many document requests. A condition has many documents.That's strange. And the inverse is that the document can be associated to many conditions. A document has new spot for notes. There's no flag flag set up nothing. The notes are like notes are. These are specific to condition. Yeah, these are conditional notes. These are new and.Um, do we want them to display anywhere? Somebody's looking at the notes? Yeah, all of this on the loan because we're we have a product right now to consolidate the three different. I think it's only three so far. Yeah, um, notice that you can, uh, edit in like either.Either clear or bind not not necessarily. I think I think it's similar to document. You know how in clear docs you can have notes about your document. Same thing for conditions. It's so that you can the underwriter and the processor could go back and forth. So like oh I I know you asked for 12,000, this is only 11/5 but I think this.This is OK or hey, I talked to the borrower, they're not getting back to me. It it it just provides inline comps as opposed to like an e-mail or or them having to make a phone call. OK, and we're we're trying to pull all those various places that you can pull notes like inside the loan into a specific place and you could you could ask this.So if this needs or want we want to put that in there, we the project is ongoing right now. We could consider that and we did design so 'cause we were working on these simultaneously when we did conditions for them. So then at least component wise structure is the same.So there's for engineering that's there's reuse here that was intentional at least in the design approach to OK from a UI perspective. I mean just from my perspective I can imagine all officers wanting to know and like see like yeah you you could heat map it too like what's what's the activity of my like there might be value in seeing it but either way it'll be.Available.Outstanding document request. So this is a government ID condition. So we have, excuse me, various doc types that you can request and then who is the request for? Is it an app level bar, cobar and then a description for the bar?You can also add additional doc requests and then exception requests. That's a fairly new concept. This is also part of the conversation we had with Kelly that we need to dive deeper into. This wasn't on, I think, our radar for the initial requirements, but there's a concept of exception requests that the.That's currently in use, so these are triggered outside of the commissions portal and then map. It was invite today. It's a separate screen that you go to. Only certain people can use it. It's a customer.OK. And what's the, what's the use case? So if you have a condition that doesn't meet what you're saying, OK, I've got all these compensated factors or in this close that an investor will allow a path or whatever it is, they have to get somebody to approve that because it doesn't exactly fit the box. OK. So it it's still attached to a condition, it's just this, it's almost like.If somebody signs on and said I'm making an exception because it's $200 short, just as an example, never good, but that example, I mean the underwriter will send it to their sign off their the person who can do a sign off exception, they do so. Does that mean that there's going to be special roles here of who can sign off or that that was on in the road map?And the road map said because it's a completely separate screen today, we're gonna leave it alone. So we don't have any OK offers. But Kelly mentioned on Friday that somebody comes back into the condition and manually keys in some data on that screen. So while we there, we need to understand. Yeah, yeah, OK.Yeah, I think I don't remember if we scheduled a meeting for a deeper dive on that, but that was new information that we got on Friday that it looks like Tim already updated the and there will, if it's not clear, there will be an audit log for this. So anything that changes, we want to be aware of it because conditions are as we're hearing like a back end, somebody goes in and edits and changes, we want to know what that was and.We don't need an admin tool for it, but we wanna at least log the facts because it's we need that forensic evidence when like things start going wrong, you know?And then dates. We have an expiration date for when that document is valid and then a follow-up date. So on on expiration date, the it's interesting the expiration date actually comes from the document that's attached to the condition.But we also track it at the condition level and So what we talked about was automating that because today it's a manual process to log it. Essentially when somebody when the when the document that's associated with the condition gets reviewed and an expiration date is added, we will then backfill that up.Up to the condition or the condition will inherit the document expiration date. If there's multiple, it'll inherit the nearest expiration date. Is there a Gemini component where we should try to determine expiration date programmatically? We we.In the past designs, we didn't get into AI stuff. It's something that we definitely we had like the that concept. Yeah, yeah, a long time ago, you know, like the new. OK, I think it'd be neat. Any data we can extract from these documents. OK, it'd be it'd be interesting for the engineers to have a assume that there is a Gemini.Endpoint where you can go do things with these docs because I think we're going to get into later. Like probably the most complicated part of this whole process is when a borrower sends us documents, how how do we coordinate them? Because are they merged? Are they separate? Are they wrong? And and I know we have all of that built in, but I could see.Even Sato's tool that does the auto indexing, if we run that first before even on the way in, I think that might be helpful because it will eliminate a ton of the manual efforts that we built tools around. OK, use that on literally everywhere we get documents, correct? Correct. So when we get there.Or point and click. They see the document, they see the data. Yeah. So I think, yeah, I think so we should encourage the use of AI and Jim and I where we can to to knock out little little things like this. Yeah. Is he is he defining the that we need to collect document type? Mm-hmm. That's an option. Yep, there's a.In fact you you can provide the prompt I want for this doc type. I want these things and and and a description of how to get them.I think we're, well, maybe this is a later conversation that will go very well, but I think it's the only thing that we do for sure. And so then we have condition status. So you can see the various conditions and how the loan is progressing through the different statuses. So you'll have a date and time stamp.As it moves through the life of the loan, can I make a comment here? Absolutely. It's important to know that and again, this is again, maybe an AI thing. This is not linear, so it can go between the underwriter and the processor several times and in fact.I think and Jina Choi can comment on this.Processors are scored on the number of bounces like like that's a underwriting touch touches, yes. So because if implications, if you have a high underwriting touch, your file's not you haven't done your job in even weeks.Thanks. So you ideally want to get to an underwriting touch count of no more than three per loan. You get one touch finals and made a team, but that's never gonna happen, right? Maybe if you get like D1C and PIW and you get all of these pings, things and it's full bingo you can do or if you're the borrower, right, because you're gonna provide everything.It was like optimal to the three touches, right? Three is really good. You right now I think we're at an average of five to six. Interesting. So that's a that's a cool metric cause that'll help us.Rank our rank the people and help underwriting managers rank. But also this is a cool like imagine if you had a little a visual of like like what happened like it went here and went back and forth and then and if you overlay the.The audit log on top of that. Imagine the power like the underwriting manager to see like, oh like, hey Jason, here, here are your files. Everything with more than 8 touch points is here and here's all the stuff you did and and there's there's improvement opportunities there, so.And I know that Josephine, we don't need to get into it now, but you have a data model for all of this for the engineer. So you guys have a we're going over the UI, but we have all of the structure. We need to discuss the post and input.Do you have the workflow for like the fates, the statuses? Yes, they don't, but they they deviate even to fight data loss. That's what we one thing when you're considering underwriting touches that are only going to do with the conditioning of this, but just things to keep in mind is that the number of touches can vary based on. OK, so and loan purpose.So if you have a purchase and you get an appraisal in, but you don't have the rest of your PTDs, I would make the exception that purchases you get your appraisal in for review. There's not a separate appraiseworthy department because your appraisal pick killer you need to have addition for that and you're found by a Co plus best worthy.If you have jumbo loans, it's maybe caveats. So just when we look at the number of touches booked over the finished total, don't do a full blanket. Maybe then you have parameters keep bucket it out based on loan purpose and a loan program.I see. So you're saying make it more granular when you you're gonna have to make it. You're gonna have to tranche, right? You guys have the cheesecake doctor programs, which is another way that that's purpose. So go talk to Lauren. We we chilled in.I think we put in all the logic of the loan program into the name of the loan program. I know actually have freaking the loan program name have to work AIO in it. I went to the whole list. You have loan programming based on amortization terms, which you don't need to do that like you should just be a conforming Texas A six and then you have amortization terms.Yeah, you know it up, but you literally break it up 10 year, 15 year, 20 year, 20 it's just. And I think the second point though, people can't number of underwriting. Just keep that in mind. Not every line is the same. Got it. You can't treat them all the time because then people are going to be like, yeah, it's a jumbo. Of course it has to extensions. That's natural.A report jumper where a conforming agency should have two to three touches. Got it. That makes sense. So refinance versus a purchase and it all is going to depending on a length. If you have different worksheet, you have an appraisal review department work, appraisal reviewers are literally going appraisal signing up on what they're going to be housing with underwriters. How much are they going to buy for keep the process? We're going to have a title review.Team, etcetera. Just keep that in mind when you when you go. Thank you. What would be an example of a touch? It's just submitting back that down, right? So, so the loan typically I think based on the status it will either be in the.Eyes of the processor or the underwriter and the status will tell you which. So it's it's kind of that back and forth status and then the the actor can move it into another status so the processor decides.This is ready for underwriter review, so they will move it. Again, think it like a JIRA ticket, like I'm moving from one to the other and the underwriter looks at it and if they agree and it's good, they can move it to what is it cleared with conditions?To close, clear to close. That is like the pass or they throw it back and say Nope, you need to do it again. So. So it's the status change that is that touch point. I've always imagine that's where clear came from, like it's very close status, but I've been.Was there, was there a recent change? I remember hearing somebody say that when the loan is in underwriting that it's only for everyone, not underwriters, but no, it it they're locked out because the underwriters they they just make that change right and I.It's I was. I was just kind of something embarrassed by saying this is a ticket we're never gonna do in front of like, I don't know, seven people and and they were all laughed like, yeah, we actually just did that. So it's it's so important, right? OK, so when the loan is in underwriting, it's read only for everybody but underwriting.Yes, I'm going to say yes. OK. Now I'm really scared of stuff that you said. Oh yeah, that's certainly possible. Like I'm going to assume it can't be done. Yeah, good. You can still get documents, but you can't modify anything else. Yeah, you can't edit it. You don't want to screw up like while underwriters have.Happening. You don't want people to go in there and be changing the. Yeah, also lower the amount of money you have to thank. The underwriter doesn't do it. The use case did it. He did it in a very specific way. Like without knowledge of the internals of bite, we weren't going to do it. Nice. Yeah, the yeah, the use case was. I mean, even the process we're talking about.Going against desired practice. But hey, I have this thing that I want the underwriter to look at. I'm going to reject document A, but I want them to look at document B on the same condition. And for that reason, I think they still won't be able to upload. Well, they want to see what they've analyzed. They want to analyze what they see right now if something's changing.I'll send a vacuum. So at Loandepot they we we had this concept of AI forgot Carlos what the term was. It was like a it was a final review and it was on a doc. So if an underwriter signed off on a condition.And had a doc associated, they could right click and they could lock that document. It cannot be modified. You can read it, you can clone it, but you can't change anything about it. You can't unassign it, you can't merge it and it it became like green checkboxed and it was locked.Carlos Sanchez   1:15:42Like the final, final stamp, yeah.Leslie Chang   1:15:44Final stamp and and so even if you sent the loan, let's say you've partially underwrote the loan and you you had like 8 docs that were good. You'd final stamp those. They're locked, but the other three go back to the processor. That way the processor can go fix that, but they can't actually change what was there that way the underwriter has.Peace of Mind, and they don't feel like they have to re underwrite the entire file because if it's screen checked only underwriters can uncheck it. So anyway, I don't know. We we don't do that here, but but that's that would be like a phase two thought is like how now that we have all this cool tech, how can we?Reduce. So when I when an underwriter is on on on view two and three and four, how do we only allow them only tell them they only have to look at the delta, they don't have to re look at the whole thing. That would be a huge labor savings. So what what's the?Loan Depot on auto save was the power auto save turned on. Do you know we we use my tool. We use doc management. I'm saying the phone LOS was it was it set to auto save? No you had to hit save. It did save. But it was the same thing like if you're out of the loan. Yeah even though it's locked you could still upload docs like it it had like the.The ancillary I call it the orphan orphanable rows could be added regardless of if it's locked or not. It's only the core MIS mobile file that was like read only. We have all the state here and I've never worked with any other London that has all the state.Carlos Sanchez   1:17:11That's kind of dangerous, isn't it? I mean.Leslie Chang   1:17:11Just.I I think that that's that's The thing is I'm not used to that everywhere that I've worked at. OK, both ways. Yellow I does not have all the state. I think other times I've been contacted.Carlos Sanchez   1:17:22Like you said something unintentionally.Leslie Chang   1:17:26Yeah, the unintentional changes, Carlos, are real and they happen. We just need to. We need Keith to build a bite time machine like go back in 10 minutes. Anyway, keep going, Leslie. All right. Is this a quick pause? Is this helpful? Is this a good?Are you guys, are we going at the right depth or I'm trying to keep it like high, high level so you can understand it but also deep dive in where we need. But I I I don't want to necessarily go into a tunnel on anything until we get through the high level.You guys, you guys want to take like a quick break or key point?Let me grab some more. Five minute break. OK. Sorry, Leslie. No, no, no, you're fine. We're going to take a quick break.Mhm.Restroom. Is it? Is it this side or the other side? Go all the way down the hall on this side and then make a left.Not like that. OK, so it is correct, I believe. OK, I think we didn't change the ticket. OK, 'cause there's like another ticket that has the setting in it. Should I say anything to Andrew or are you already talking to him? Uh, we'll ask him to check to see if we'll see something. I hate them. Yeah, I know the two. We need a better way. I would.I have a as long as putting together a prototype scenario, I think the right, right. But it's not acting names for employees. I can download. We can show. I mean, I probably can show it. And it's like, she's like, OK, we can have it. There's no way. Yeah, the respond is that right? Yeah, yeah.OK, uh, OK.Carlos, are you with us? OK, we're starting back up again. All right. So next is the condition notes. So you can add a condition at the note level and at the loan level. So I know this is kind of when I talk to Tim's team, this is not fully vetted yet.Carlos Sanchez   1:29:16I'm here.Leslie Chang   1:29:35All of the notes requirements, but there's a concept of, again, notes at a condition level and one at the loan level. So then if I add a note here, going to save it.How do you exit? Oh, OK.OK. And then how do you access the notes portal from? Oh, it's the bell icon. Oh, the bell icon. OK, notice for this we didn't have a save button. So we'll talk about that. Is the red symbol painting like a bolts thing or is that just the that was a bolt thing? OK, yeah, yeah, it should. When you close that condition, it should update.real time on the team because our engineers are stillNot for long. OK, so if you click on this bell icon, this is essentially the conditions portal notes. So you would have all of the conditions associated with this loan here. So these would be.Specific to the condition and this would be specific to the loan, is that right? Yeah, OK. And so please wait, so you add them to the loan by this little.Add up there that will fill or we'll see later when we do a update of the loan status. I'm I'm throwing user perspective the updates. Is it intuitive? Yeah.I know. No, I think it's something that, yeah, I think that could be flushed out a little bit if we that initial portal was starting to slow down by the time we're getting there. So I agree. I I don't know that updates is the it should be condition involved maybe just to keep it so agreed.Yeah. So when you add a new condition, we have a visual marker that says whether or not it's red and that's specific to the the role. Is that correct, Tim? So if if I'm a processor and I viewed it before I open the note, there'll be, I think it's a little blue dot, if I remember.Perform the figmas and then when you view it, that dot goes away. But when if like someone else with a different role logs in and has not yet viewed that, then it would be considered unread for that specific user. Did I get that right? Yeah, yeah, it's user specific. It's user specific, not role specific. Yeah, we don't do that today.Yeah, it's it's user specific in this project. So we we we effectively want the the user to almost treat it like Outlook like they can. That's right. They can at a glance see unread notes. Yeah. And so that that will probably be in the fake model. Yeah, if you go into the.It's OK. And also Mars one is that red as well. OK, um, OK, let's see. Where were we? I didn't know.And so when you do add a note, you'll see it kind of in line next to under the condition notes field. You may not necessarily see the entire note depending on how long it is, but it'll give you a little bit of a preview of the last note that was added in addition to a date.And timestamp. Um.Size the note, it's a rich text editor, yes, size.Is there a collapse button to see all?So the rule here is when there's one note, you'll see the the first note and then the yeah, most recent note and then.There's only one. You'll still have the add note button. If there's more than that, then you'll see show all notes and that'll open up the notes panel filters to all of the notes for that condition.I mean, you'll see that in some, I think some of the way, yeah.Um. OK, so that's notes. Um.Is that does that cover all of the requirements for notes? I know that that was still the sorry, there's document. Oh yeah, but in terms of the conditions, the notes conditions, so there is were separate. There are three sets of notes there are.Condition global notes. There are condition specific notes and there are doc notes. Is that those are the three levels? Yeah. OK, so condition global is like every single loan gets that same note. No, like for for a given loan. It's sort of like a it's sort of like a condition. Imagine the portal is like a place to go and you might have a general.Comment that's not specific to a condition, but it's general. Like for example, I don't know what a good example would be like, oh, hey, Mr. or Mrs. Thunder, keep in mind that this loan officer or this borrower is on vacation next week. So this condition is pending, but it will be there like like.Something high level recommendations, nice data transaction. There's that has a record of the other type, 100%, yeah. So there's global conditions. I didn't know. No, I I think, I think Mark was what Mark was saying, at least what I interpreted as saying is there's.Long notes, condition notes and document notes. Those are essentially Hmm. But long notes it's it's that on the project, right? Well, so and I think This is why we didn't necessarily put long notes in there because rather than as I'm OK, then maybe maybe I just call it updates because.They're not loan notes like the loan notes that you will you're buildings right now, right? These are loan notes. These are updates basically coming from the individual board. So the loan level burden of notes that we call updates.There's one type and you have the condition level, which is you know, Leslie is just doing or assigned to the condition. You have the documents level. Well, so it's global condition notes. What do you mean? What do you mean global? What do you mean by that? As long as meaning notes to this portal that's not linked to a condition?No, there's no no condition. No, it's just it's always tied to a loan in some capacity. It starts at the loan as the parent that condition notes for that loan. So the updates you're seeing are core loan, yeah, loan notes, not condition specific.So the core loan notes that these work out, yeah, core loan notes are separate. So then I retract what I said. There is loan notes, then within conditions portal, there are condition notes and then the docs have their own notes. Is that right? Yeah, there there is no condition portal note we we could.We could. Well, the idea here was that the what we're calling loan notes were isolated to the conditions portal. It's the conditions portal. It's a culture of loan notes that has something to do with conditions. It has something. So we were overloading the conditions because we don't want to overload this with the friendship.OK, hello stuff in there. So it's so it's kind of a hybrid way to get in there, but we don't have to build it because it's already it already exists. It already exists. The other key call out with notes is. So we've covered one of the main deviations from notes. I'm still confused.Are you guys? Are you confused too still? I think I so there's there's notes. So this is a loan, right? Yep. And there's notes for all these conditions on the loan. And then if you open up the condition, it has its own notes. So a loaned condition has notes. So. And then there's also a loaned document which have notes. Those are the scopes.Yes, so yes, speak to what you said the first part. So the the loan level notes which would be something like borrower's appraisal came in low, so they're coming in with more money. Here are all the conditions to the underwriter. It's a general loan note, so they're aware kind of like a cover letter.And then the conditions. Each condition has its own specific, oh, you wanted a government ID, you know he he dogging it. We have the passport instead, whatever it is. That's a level, a Commission level though, and then the document notes.This is all pages, even though you see the last page blank, whatever. So you can do those grant. So then document can be multiple conditions across multiple loans. No as well, not across multiple loans, just many of the conditions of docs are many to many within the loan. If if you have another loan you will have to make it.Copy of that doc. Yeah, into that one. Sorry. Oh, I was gonna say just to clarify. So when we say a condition though, we're talking about condition within the loans conditions. One row. That's correct. Global. There's no concept of a global condition other than a template to by which you can add a.Condition or clone one for that long and you'll see that here in a little bit. I have a key call out with notes. So we talked about one of the main deviations from the bike data model was the condition status. Well notes is another big deviation.From the data model, because today there are notes, but they are. It's just a single text text box and they just append this text box. So there's no intelligence or transparency or way to notify with that model. And that's a huge pain point based on the research that we've.We did with underwriters process the process today is how well they can communicate with one another. It's non-existent by, but even though it depends, it knows when it automatically appends. It knows who you are and the date and time and the content, but it's just goes into your good blog. Yeah, it sounds like a.It's like a pattern, right? It shows like brackets and name of the times. Yep, yeah, this is like the the notes is like a 30% of like the the value of of this tool I think. Yeah, and and then the the second byte deviation is that.Invite. You can only have one document. That one document can only be linked to one condition. So we're going to have one document can be linked to many conditions. It creates a lot of pain around workarounds that they have to do with documents because they they have to clone the document. Yeah, four times.So and then they put and then they have to clean it up for delivery. I don't know the and I don't want to do that because they have to have that Commission attached to or the document attached to that Commission anyway, so they're not going to, but the example of that would be a bank statement.Has. Hey, the underwinder just can't see. It happens. It's a bite limitation. It's a one to one relationship.Yeah, they just they just they just put some traceability. We're we're gonna fix that. We like, yeah, that's the best. Yeah. And then we have like like a total side note like whenever we say byte deviation, we need to pseudo support people if if a if an underwriter and a.Are using the conditions portal and they go to bite the the loan needs to be as close enough as possible. So so we're trying to make it backwards compatible but you you will have issues like if our conditions portal has mini to mini, I don't know what we're going to do in bite to make it.Behave or and maybe we decide it's not going to. And once a loan is a conditions for a loan, we won't do it in by. That's where we landed for. Yeah, yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna red, red, black, white it by requires you to touch it up.No, it's that if it's a CMG process, we implement it. So because we're probably better touched on wanting to go get this docked by because they want, they want to trace through it if somebody else makes sense. That's probably that makes a lot of sense. I was wondering why it's still this is Bo.Thank you, everybody. Bo helped us coordinate our space today. Thank you. Thank you, Bo.All right. Another thing a processor is going to do is they are going to sign docs to a condition. We would do that via the Add Docs button and there's several ways that a processor would do that. They would either have the documents in clear docs.Or maybe the borrower would just e-mail the documents to them so then it would just be on their local machine. And then is there a portal that yeah, they can use the condition, the the borrower, the smart app, you can go straight to click.OK, it goes straight to clear docs. So if I click on add docs, you can see it's a little bit cut off. Some loan officers have their own web websites. Oh OK, that is that is OK. So there's two ways you can add docs. You can browse and add docs from clear docs. So if I click on that.Oh, OK. OK, yeah. So this is, let's pretend this is a a docu clear docs with documents added to it. So this is the left side and this these are the final docs and then I'll go back to.Tim. And then if we how do we add a drag and drop. If you want, you can drag and drop a condition on or a document under the condition. It'll do the process that you want. Oh, OK.OK, so the uh, got it. OK, sorry. The other thing is, uh, the pipe line does not allow you to create the same condition category and the same condition number. You can't have multiple instances, but the API supports it.UI does not API does. So like I need a driver's license from Scott and I need a driver's license from Annie. Those are all to the same conditions. I will be able to do that.So if I click on a document, this is, let's just say a driver's license. I'm going to add that document to this condition and then it'll give you a preview of that document. This is my prototype, so I'm jumping around a little bit. I'm sorry.It'll give you document properties, the file name, the document type, description. You can modify these. This is where you see the expiration date, document notes, the associated condition you can.This is also functionality for what is it? Annotation. Yeah, so you can do markups. You can, as you can see, you can block out some functionality as well.So so we did a lot of work on that. So it now handles burn and non burn. So you can decide will annotation be a removable layer or will it be burned onto the dock.I I don't know. I I know the feature is there. I don't know who decides, butSo what? Yeah, whatever the requirement is, I know that Keith. So that was a we needed bike that our recent bike release, the one that's that's going out has that annotation functionality. So I'll defer to the product team on on what that those rules are.Because you can't.I just need to alternate up.But if you want it highlighted it, it's helpful. But you don't want that. Yeah, yeah I think that'd be sent. If Burns is sent, that's a big conversation, and to have people want to have, and you're only delivering to agencies right now, but once you start delivering to my aggregators, that's going to be very problematic.Right. And that's why the burn option, you can do it without a burn. So the you guys understand the concept of burn. So you have your doc, if you put annotation on it, if you burn it, that means that the doc itself, the the binary of the doc has the annotation in it. It's it's there. If it's not burned, it's.It's a layer that can be removed easy and I think what Jina Choi is describing is when we sell our loans, we don't want the annotation to necessarily be there. We just want the raw documents because annotations are like internal notes. So I think signatures are the only things now that I'm thinking about getting a signature by the underwriter on a 1008.For example, we have to sign it. So I think their signature is part of it. I could be wrong, but that makes the most sense to me. Fantastic because they have to sign the 90 to 90 or exactly something like that. That makes sense. But but anything like so definitely don't if it's gonna be, I would do it role based, right? So.Cross anyone who's not an underwriter. Sure, underwriter you can break because underwriter's not going to annotate separate them. And if it's signature, it can it can be a different workflow, right? Like potentially. So anyway, burn is a so for product people. Burn is a thing that will need to be.Well documented. And then when you kind of document the Commission portal, it's automatically saving into the documents. Yeah, one example to type in. No. Oh, OK. It doesn't pull any docs. It's pointing to the file. No, if you just refresh. Oh, OK.It'll own metadata, yes. It'll own whatever the whatever byte supports, it'll it'll save that. But then we have what I call extended data, which is like, oh, here is the extra stuff like notes, flags, all the stuff that's like not part of byte will be in clear. So your guys's data model will be a a hybrid.It'll be clear. It'll be by step plus whatever else I get. Andy, it looked like you were gonna ask me a question. Yeah, I had a question about the the model that was open with the option to print on, say.Doc. Click on the document. Oh, OK, got it.Is that OK? It's a bolt thing. OK, that's not got it. OK, so was the Annie wanted to go back to the to your annotation, which annotation doesn't look closer to what he's gonna look like this prototype for the annotation annotations.Should be the only other one I had questions about.Squares and the colors. We'll go over the Figmas. Josephine and Tim will go over the Figmas and that is basically what you want to refer to like this. This is functionality Tim's in terms of design is much closer, but it's still not the final Figma, so I would defer to that.If you're making any, what was your question though? Was it just what are the different shapes do? Yeah, it wasn't clear to me on that. OK, it's it's really even if the prototypes have much around it because it's a representation of what's stored.Docs today bite. So it's you can draw. Literally you can draw a square like with a just that's a that only has borders around it. So you can highlight something on the page where you can type text or you can put an arrow point or you can click an arrow point. It's really just drawing shapes.And typing text and the difference it is between how permanent the thing that you're doing is. So you have some that are just overlay of.Like just a general I think for anybody to see internal it's just you and Vern don't say it's it's like permanent to the doc. Yeah yeah I I would have to double check and I think Keith has Keith Roberts has there's a referral where I think somewhere there's tool there's an annotation.So you might be able to just plug it in and I I think we're kind of indifferent to like all of the pieces. I don't know that we need to. I don't know that we're necessarily prescriptive. If you guys just say here is a general strip for annotation, I I think we're we're good with that.Or we compare what Byte does say, OK, let's get as close as possible. Oh yeah, you know what I mean? Right. So, yes. So we're, I think there's some flexibility there. Yeah, 'cause it's, it's fully live in by. Yeah, yeah, yeah, annotation exists today. Yeah. And.Byte already does the like visible to you only correct the burning concept. So Byte made that those safe features available through the API. That's the big thing. Now now we have that flexibility in this tool. That was a hold up that conditions portal had last year.OK, So what what you're seeing again when you add docs and you do it from clear. Clear has this concept. Clear Docs has a concept of draft documents and final documents. So I'm going to select a document added to my condition and then I'm going to refresh. But this is a bolt limitation, so just assume that when I submit the document.It shows up with a a preview. It has to be final to attach it, right? No, no, no, not as processor processor. You can do draft or final.Underwriter you can be fine. So you you don't have to process. You wouldn't want it to be final because the processor is is getting the docs right. Well that means it's it's going to be in by you. You mean it's on the right side. Draft is right. So the draft if you if you attach it to the left is strapped.That move it to the right and then attach it as if it's on the left, it's not in the LOS. It goes to essentially being in the LOS when the condition is marked as ready for underwriting. So we want we wanted to give the flexibility for processors to associate documents to conditions.Accept them, but not send it over to underwriting until they literally indicate that the condition is ready for underwriting the table. So that's when it pushes over to interest. So by the time the underwriter gets it, it's in the loan, right? That's what I was concerned about. OK, but we don't want the underwriter to draft off that.Exactly. OK. Do you guys understand the left right concept? Yeah, like the safety docs, right? It's correct. It's and the the the main difference is the underwriter can see the right and if an once an underwriter sees it, they can't unsee it. So if you put something in there like an extra.Income or rental. Now the underwriter has to legally or fiduciarily or fiduciarily they they have to acknowledge it. So the left side gives us a sandbox so that processors and LOS can have docs and be prescriptive about what they pass. So that's that's the main idea.Behind it. It's it's it's not a you. At the end of the day, you can miss the request. Fiduciary really. But it's not a yeah, it's like no. That's because you're a shady underwriter.You put on your underwriter glasses that have like blinders.OK, so you'll see a preview of the document. Here's a mini thumbnail and these would represent if it's a multi-page document. You would have multiple pages here where you could review each page of the document by clicking on it so you can delete the document.If you're making changes to the metadata against it, you can save changes. You can also reject it, which will allow you to submit a note.On or re request the document. This one's slightly different. Yeah, if it's so, it varies depending on the role. Your processor you have full full view of the document request when you do a rejection.Because you may want to change some details about that request. If you're an underwriter, then it's just you're leaving a note to the to the condition to communicate back to the processor why he rejected that.So the process is about communicating back to the borrower. That's why you see the document request. The underwriter is about communicating back to the process. When you hear, when you see document request, assume that is to the borrower where the borrower will be given their.Their browser to be able to see this. Underwriters don't ever talk to borrowers, so the processor is like the doc fetcher. So that's why there's that that delta the curious question. So like if the processor somebody has to get some people title.Who? How do we do that today? How do we try in the process or it would contact the title company and talk to their measure officer or the title officer. So for like all these, do we see ourselves filling portals to the other parties to transact? Yeah, let's say you like a base to like a vendor portal spot.Home Depot we we did it with e-mail. So we built a we had a a thing called docs at londepot.com and depending on in the end and what you had to do was you had to include the loan number in the subject line.And depending on the domain where it came from, like at First American, we knew it was title or if it was from a a credit company, we knew it was credit. So that was 10 years ago. So they used e-mail, but but we could certainly have a.Uh, a portal with a drop on top of it, but it could go to external port. It could, yeah, yeah. And just be careful with the third party portals. It's very difficult to get the third party vendors to engage the portal for once. Yeah, the main type of companies work with hundreds. So yeah, it's like.That's why we did e-mail because it was quick. They were they were already emailing. Hey, can you just CC docs at at you know ld.com and and that was an easy thing to do, which we have. We have that tool. Just be careful if you go down the line looking at for it because it makes sense, right? I think I should have to get someone to engage in that. It's really.Yeah, I can really see. Yeah, I'm gonna get. Can't really see.So you also have functionality here. If if the borrower sends you like a 10 page document that includes different stuff, you can split, merge or rotate I think. Is this available on bite now? I'm not sure the rotate yeah.It was all invite and rotate. So generally speaking, pretending you have your docs come in and we don't have a lot of control over how the borrower's gonna submit them, so you might get.3 pages of the same doc, but page 123 is separate documents. Those would need to be merged, or you might get two sets of bank statements for two months that you want to separate for two different conditions.Generally the the tool here gives you the capability to split and merge and rotate and and take certain pages and and effectively create the document that you need in order to satisfy the condition. So this is sort of a doc.Tool that that will let you kind of pick and choose the pages you need and then whatever you don't have or you need, you can re-request that from the borrower and you can say what you need. Yes. So split and merge, do they pull from all the documents that are in that final correct document you select?He said, yeah, it's the document. So. So merging it would be selected. What are you merging it? It's just one document. So merging that's selective. Here's an example, right? I'm a borrower. I oh, somebody's asking for my tax returns. I have my cell phone here. Let me take.50 pictures of every individual page and I upload that and that comes as 50 individual images that I now need to merge into one doc. So I may have, you know, all those images associated as conditions and they do it that way. Or I may not and they have them in an e-mail file. There's like a multitude of ways of.Send it as Mark pointed out. Now I want to merge them. So this gives you the ability to do that. It'll create an it'll always we will always create a new document. So in that example you have let's go with 10 just to be simpler. You have 10 docs that are one page each.Edition that these 10 satisfy. So you're gonna go in here and they'll either be queued because they're new, they just came in and you'll check box them or you'll go into the clear docs and you'll find and select them and then you'll say merge. It'll make a new copy of all those pages and it will call it.You know, tax returns, and that'll be the one that gets saved. You got a new responsible merge? Yes. I think he does that. Yeah, just becomes.Does it? I think I think that show that the split and merge on here work and he'll oh, it does. I think it is merged. This one is only one page. Yeah, it was dispatcher. So if we're talking about maybe and and that's a good point. I get there. It doesn't matter. If you run some right ahead of time, so that this paper is a lot less.Transcript. No, it'd be the tax. If it does what we think it does, right? Well, which metadata? Joe Farmer. Do that. Yes. Joe Farmer. Yep. OK.That that's a good one to show. Um.To show the split and then merge you can use. Oh here we go and and Rusty brings up a good point. When these docs get uploaded, if we ran the Gemini process, this manual effort will become a lot less necessary because hopefully AI would have.Auto merged or split for us before we ever got here. That did not exist before, so I want to add that to our requirements. I want Sato's any dot that comes in should be an auto index should be attempted before we ever see it so that that we're dealing with.Hopefully cleaner doc sets. We and only really getting the true right and and we had in previous in previous like sexualization we put in a panel that called out, hey, here's the things that I noticed about the document. Here's like can you do yeah that would be like another.So that's getting into like doc verification, like, oh, you uploaded a driver's license, but we noticed it was expired. Yeah, that's that's certainly a phase two. So I want that's like doc validation.We'll do that later. It's phase one to say it's Mark Hansen's versus Troy. Is that phase one? I don't think we're doing any doc data extraction. That would be, yes, that would be a manual process here. Well, I think what we'll do is we'll do what Samra does today, which is we can do merging and splitting.And identification. But any more document type, yeah document type and and it'll it'll clean up the docs. So technically you could take 10 docs and shuffle them and give them the Satos tool and you'll get back a nice like here are your six doc types and and they're all merged and these are what they are and that would reduce the.The need on this screen to do the merge and split. Hopefully the docs are now clean enough that you just simply associate them, but you still have the merge and split if tool bumps or if somehow it doesn't get run or we do an ad hoc or something.Yep.But either way, you do have this kind of CRUD functionality. He says he splits the bank statements, but he won't say that the Chase Fund versus the Bank of America.Right. So somebody will still have to. That would happen here. Chase is it's Leslie's or Mark's chase, right? In the future we can get further, right? Yeah. Imagine if his tool extracted data, went and looked at open conditions and basically try to do what Candor's doing and auto assign, but we're not.not there yet.Document description's not on the split. This is split. It doesn't auto merge Mark on the what is the split. Go back. I do have the document. I totally it's new product departments coming from Mark. He's gonna be here. What? Tell him we want. We look forward to him demoing this. We're being merged on this tomorrow.Like, what's the level of detail we want to provide? The reason why it's how would it be. I'm afraid of that. We still think so. So when you do this, it looks like I want you to and then.Yeah, that's like a classical. So we're gonna have to take too much of this saying Martenson, it's Chase July 8th, right? Yep, there's document name, but the description being different than the name, right? The name is a drop down, but description with no, no. So document document type.Document type document name is where you, but it's not. They're not separate data data. Yeah, the doc description. Maybe even not. No, no.But right has document type and not description and document category and then description is a full text.Yeah, it's brief from text field that I got to add the description to invite. Yeah, that's what I'm saying, but it's not here.We can. We can add it. We can add it. We should check. I mean, we when we looked at this place. Well, let me let me look it up like I had it.I tell you if I open right now and you think that it's still thoughts. Yep. And while we're waiting, why don't we why don't we continue just so we can get through the yeah, this demo. So this is the prototype supports the document split. So this is a document with like 40 some pages. So then you would.Select the doc, sorry, document type. You can name it. So let's say you ask for three months bank statement, but they sent you like all of them in one document set. So you can break it out by like let's say January, February, March. You drag and drop those into that document.And then you can associate a condition or multiple conditions to those documents and then you can kind of keep working your way down. So then like let's hypothetically say it's January, February, March is all included in this document set. This is how you would split it out.And when do the fish here, so take the associations you have.Oh, it's because there's no, like, documentary. They're all accepted. Got it. OK, dragging a document on that. That's the difference.Yeah, it does. So. So something that got into a prototype, like, hey, what do you want to do in this scenario? And so trying to get them to cause they can. We'll essentially, I mean, split anything that's left over there. It'll create, we stand by the lockdown.Document. It's like a leftovers, right? Like leftovers. So visually if I have 30 pages and I'm dragging and think of it like a I'm, I'm doing a visual drag and drop to do my split, my source document, the pages go away. Yeah, so you know kind of what's left and anything that's left.Can be saved as like a leftovers or miscellaneous, which isn't part of anything and that's OK. Plus you still have the original unsplit document, so you never lose anything and you can always kind of like clear docs as a time machine, so you can always go back to a previous version.Version. So does that answer your question about the pages? Are you auto?Like to PDFI think so yeah. Any yeah everything here the assumption is that is a PDF. It's a if it's a JPEG or an image it it will get converted ahead of time. The the prototype that we got as well. Thanks. Doc says that the.OK, what about Excel?Hang on, Excel.Well, I think I think you have the concept. You can support non PDF clear docs or any doc type, but merge any sort of IO functionality would only apply to PDFs. I'll put it that way. So you could certainly have an Excel file and upload it and upload it, but if you it wouldn't.To be available here because it's it's a it's not a PDF. I mean we we could you know at the end of the day it's like like however Excel converts to PDF like through the PDF printer like like well.Your your results will vary, right? Depending on the type of doc. See if this is where underwriters are also gonna be working, they have that one there. She yeah, I don't want to see alphabetic. They just Excel and say that by test when they uploaded. So let's add that as a take away and let's see what what we think there like and I I make an assumption too.Should they use that GIC one, so I presume it is unless there's a proprietary like PDF fillable that they're using. We can make it available as a Excel. The only reason I need it to be PDF is if I want to merge it with a condition for this, but I think the conversion PDF is for a loan document delivery and you doc you need delivering more of them. So that's why like.If even though you support Excel, it if byte converts PDF, you're gonna want to convert it because we're Oh yeah, then and ultimately this is all going to byte anyways. So if they convert it already, then we we we gain that. Yeah, we're we're not doing anything special.OK, so this is the merge. You just saw the split. So if you wanted to merge a document, then you could just add whatever documents in it. It's kind of like a little bit of a wizard functionality that walks you through that and you can.You can scan the documents preorder pages within the document.I think you can pull them out of the document, basically get your merge ordered and kind of arranged the way that you want to. So there's additional intricate tools here. We don't need to get that. The goal is to not go into Adobe, which is what they do today. Yeah, they they will.There are cases where people will manually print out a bunch of docs, put them in the order and scan it back in because they don't really. Oh, I don't have an Adobe editor and I don't have a license. So, so this, this is meant to let you do everything sort of electronically. Oh wow, I didn't know that. That's interesting.OK, so then So what we what you saw is just browse and add docs from clear. And the other way you can add documents is upload them from your computer. And I think Tim, you sent me a bunch of the documents. Does this actually do a preview?Yeah, OK. I don't know where I saved that. So it's more like, are you gonna try and drag drop? Is that what you're trying to do? Does it support drag and drop? Yeah. OK, then maybe Tim's just showing off his wall skills. Seriously. He's like, oh, that's awesome.Oh, I know it'll also. So I have some I'm still working on the Gemini integration and transcription. There are these are some sample mortgage docs. I'm gonna drag and drop it.And then let's see review file. Nice.Um, because the other way you'll get documents from a bar is they'll simply e-mail it to you as opposed to, um, shipping it via the portal.By the way, that is the this. This use case I would say is I'm kind of making it up. It's like 70% of the use case will be stuff e-mail. Typically the docs are not in the loan because that typically means that the borrower used the portal and most borrowers do not use the portal, they will just.E-mail the docs. The two common ones that they said was the e-mail that's most followed by uploading the miscellaneous bucket on the current world that exists today, right? Right. I don't know how which which? Yeah, in either case.Having Sato's tool in between that and and what we do here will will give this a much cleaner experience. That's not part of our rules. So we we probably want to, I guess figure out.I don't know where that lives. Does that live in clear docs or does that live in the doc portal? I I don't or both. Like how do we ensure that because what you what she just did, she just added a doc outside of clear docs. So we probably need both tools to handle any new doc goes through Santos index process.You know what I mean? So anyway, just a side thought. It's like an API packet. And it's very fast, so it should return. We should be able to return the results in line while the while the user waits. Oh, that's it's it's very quick. You literally just adjusted that.Oh, is it kind of reconverge in it? No, no, no. He said submit a PR. He'll look forward to review. Ask him to say Mark wants. Mark doesn't know what a PR is.Anyways, OK, so assume that all of the documents that I have from the borrowers, I've attached them to respective conditions. So then I want to submit this loan to underwriting.Is that Tim? Oh, here. Refresh your screen. Just one second, OK?Um, another thing you call after a document, by the way, is.After a document is reviewed and accepted, it will show with the attach icon over there on the on the right. See those little attach icons with the number next to them on the far right.So document about Leslie. Paper book. Paper book. Yeah. So you're referring to this? No. Oh, this one. OK, yeah. It allows you to click just view the, you know, the documents have been accepted onto on the condition.The idea is that the the buttons there are calling out anything that needs to be reviewed, so there's a clear call to action. So if somebody sees something needs to happen with that condition, the attachment icons just to provide path to get.You know stuff.So I'm a processor 3. I I'm done attaching all of my documents. I want to update the loan status. So what it's going to prompt you to do is essentially input a note. You're not going to actually update the status on this page by clicking.Open Byte status. You can see you're updating the loan status here, but in real life you would go to the status page in Byte because of all of the scripts and macros, so we don't want to do that within the portal, we want to just accept a note.From the processor that gets submitted to the underwriter and then it would just take you to the status screen within bite. It's going to take you directly to that screen because we want to make sure that we trigger all the appropriate scripts and macros from that screen. Can we do that, Rusty? Can we have?This clear window popping white screen.Yes, Keith Robertson from Invite. Invite. Invite. Yes. OK Keith Robertson. OK, basically said that that wrapper. So it's this application. It's an extension of byte. OK, so we can pop a byte window.We can now have it. Yeah, map it to. OK. And and we're doing that because we don't want to deal with all the macros. Yeah. Changing a service constantly like updating those macros and OK, got the new one. Yeah, that was. Yeah. OK, that was.So essentially what I went through here is the initial processor review. So we've the automated conditions have been run, we've assigned documents to the conditions and then we just submitted to underwriting and left a note. So then the next stage would be the underwriter initial review.And then they would add conditions. So let's go to that. So right here, this is just a bolt prototype. So imagine invite. I'm now logging in as an underwriter. We wouldn't have a screen that we would toggle. So then I'm changing it to the underwriter.And then underwriter received ready for.This one. OK, thank you. Could use what happened. So the processor finished. I mean that how that behaves it's a mock. It's a mock up. Yeah, this. So this. Yeah. So you went to the underwriter, just looked over to the new kind of user. But then that was that. Oh, that was fake too. That was.So that that was to choose a loan to to play with. Yes. Yeah. So we added that feature. Yeah. Is everybody clear on that, that this is just the prototype? Imagine the the underwriter logged in and this is what they're seeing now. They open the loan, you know, they open the loan. It's ready for them to look at it. Yeah. So the loan is now.In an underwriter received status, I'm Leslie underwriter. I'm logging in with my profile. My view is going to be different from whatever the processor 3 is seeing. So active is different for me because I'm an underwriter. So what's considered active for an underwriter is different from AP3.So I mean, make QA so much easier. No, it's like how much for the head goes doing that. I mean we have that here in the prototype. So then we decided not to do a condition pipeline.I I don't. I imagine that's something we want to do. Phase. Yeah. Phase two. Yeah. So. So you will get how you got here is how however you go into bite to do it today. In the future, there's a vision of a.Pipeline that's got your loans and then maybe it's got like see these highlighted data, the red circles. Imagine those are actually in the grid. So we know how many loans are out, how many conditions are outstanding or need to review. That way you can selectively choose which loan to go into, but that's a phase two.You should hear that they might want that on the dashboard. Uh huh. Which is cool 'cause the more publicity we can get to this tool. Yep, is is better. They love the dashboards. Yeah, yeah.OK. So as Tim mentioned, there's a clear call to action. We have a couple of conditions here that have docs to review. You also have this, I guess filter button for lack of a better word where you can that's no, so.Docs, but it's what triggers the workflow. The whole point of the workflow is to give them that centralized space where they can go through all of the documents they need to review either, but regardless of how they were.It's like wizard mode. You can click the row or you can do wizard mode and wizard will just step you through each one. If you just go through and accept documents, it will walk you through what you should open. So you see we have condition assets 001005004.Or so you can click through them. I'm going to say accept.So now here the next thing they do is clear the clear the conditions. So that's why we have those buttons, those primary buttons back one step up and click on clear. I don't know why it's cutting off on your screen. So it's not really setting the condition status, it's an action button that sets.The data. Yeah, yeah, it's just. So when you click clear, it, you know, set up, saves the status and it saves changes. Yeah, I'm sorry, it didn't say is it kind of like the button we haven't cleared today. It's like the little submission notes.Notes.This is. Yeah, it's just once that steps data. That's why it's not the data. Yeah, and it doesn't change anything. It's coming back, change backwards. Yeah, the status changes. Yeah, didn't updates. Yeah, but the you know how the has it. You know how long status is like it's all. So condition status is now it's not like.One field with Pina. This is just servicing the relevant statuses that they have actually interact with when they're reviewing documents. Those three statuses are cleared, not cleared and suspended. They may see something that is really bad and they need to suspend the loan.And for processor it would be ready for underwriting, ready for underwriting and not ready. Yeah, so that it would be different depending on the the role again and not ready doesn't change data, only ready changes data.But we only have two roles. We have processor and underwriter.OK. So I'm just accepting all the docs and then let's say I want to add an additional condition. I have my add condition here. And so these are all of the, I don't know what you call it, all the all of our, yeah, all of our standard built in conditions.And so you can click on the various.Categories and then they'll they'll display. You can also do a search if you know that you have a specific. There's also the the idea of a standard conditions and that's in bite today.Well it's are relative to the selection you have in the after results, but no, it's search to all. OK, it searches all. Yeah, there's not enough in the individual lists. I think it would make sense. Yeah, I like that better because then you don't have to undo because if you're typing you typically.I want this. I want this regardless when you're I was gonna. I think it's it's thing here but it says search search all conditions. OK.We also have a concept. I know a lot of users, they have their own conditions that aren't part of the system, so they're having to write their own custom conditions every single time.Correct me if I'm wrong, but they'll have like stickies or notebooks, Excel spreadsheet, Excel spreadsheets, very archaic ways of storing their own custom conditions. So every single time they're having to kind of manually type those in. So one of the things that the conditions portal does is you can create your own.Custom condition and then that's saved within the portal. So then you can keep recycling those conditions and not having to manually input them every time. So it's a huge lift in terms of functionality. So here you can see where you would add a custom condition, name, category.Let's see, there's two. There's two sides to this, right? So bytes does allow you to add ad hoc conditions, but it doesn't allow you to save it for future use on other loans. So this one has the ability to click the chat box, save it as a template, and it will.Save it to your list of templates and then you can add it. But but this is a love hate feature. The the users love it, but executive management hates it because you're effectively saying, hey, you can we're going to give you a tool to allow you to easily bypass our out-of-the-box conditions, so.Like Candy would argue, I hate this feature, but it's a it's a mandatory, it's a necessary evil. So what we'd probably want to do with this is like we'd want to do data mining once this is out and look at all of the custom conditions and if we see.500 people with the same types, we we might want to turn that into an out-of-the-box because the problem is a custom condition is slightly variant and and it's not consistent and it's harder to audit. It'll also be neat AI wise, right? As people are adding custom conditions, recommend a recommended. Yeah, that's a great feature.Yeah, template. Yeah, so the user.Adds a custom condition. Is it user specific or do other? Yeah, that's what Josephine was just saying. It's user specific. And if they get to save it, do they get to delete it after they save this? I assume that you have your own little admin for your conditions.Yeah, your custom conditions, is that right? Yeah. So there's a if you if you close this, uh, if we haven't deleted closely, there's I don't think we did add or delete. We need. Yeah, that's a good custom condition. So you see my custom templates under the categories.That would be any custom condition that you create will automatically be added to this list, but then you can also add it to like a custom list.Yeah, so we're not ever automatically clearing stuff, right? That none of this is like like a short ask earlier is like, it's not high, right? That'll be a that'll be a Candor thing. And then eventually we can start to do it, but we're gonna start with Candors.Here's the problem. This will be that it's like, let's say we can do it. Great. The problem at a multi-million dollar company is to solve it. Well, it's also if I'm an underwriter, my job is I'm like a detective and and you're basically saying ignore this evidence, trust us.And that like goes against an underwriter. So like until we can get an underwriter to like trust auto cleared stuff, it's not going to matter anyways because they're still going to look at it. So like we're going to use Vendor is kind of our atlas. If they start to trust it, then we can start to piggyback and say, OK, let's build our own CMG version where we.We also do stuff canned orders copy or or or cover and hopefully by then the underwriters will will trust us more.OK, so I'm adding a custom condition to this loan. If it's a really obscure condition then I won't save it as a template. But if I think I want to recycle and reuse it, I'll just click on the save as template and then I'll add condition.And then do I refresh it to see it? Yeah, OK.In time check, I'll probably leave in about 1520 minutes. OK, I'm not sure if you guys are cool with that. Looks like yeah, I haven't tested. Yeah, so assume that they would show up in my custom templates anytime you create your own custom condition. Otherwise, if you want to add, let's say, random conditions from this.Category. Let's say the processor missed it. You can just click them, click add. At that point you have the option to edit description and who the request is for. Conversely, if you wanted to remove, you could click them and then add remove. So I'm just going to click. You could just click add at this point.You could also do a custom list and so a list would be. Let's say I do a lot of. I'm in Miami and I do a lot of condos or something like that. So you know you have a list of conditions that you always associate with a property type that is condo. So then you can just.Grab those conditions, put them in a list. You can also include your custom conditions if they're not part of the default conditions, and then you would. Essentially, that's your new custom list of conditions, if that makes sense.And it pops up.Well, so you you actually so it's a separate section on that like.Says my lists. For some reason it didn't let me delete there too. Oh, there we go. Can you get a delete custom list? You know, you can delete a custom list. It shows dynamically. Oh, on the top there. So.So that's where your any list that you save are. If it's a list that so if you create a new one, you're not gonna see the delete button because it hasn't been created yet. But if you open the existing list, you should see click on the edit icon to the right of the existing list. Oh, OK.That allows you to edit the list, and that's the delete list is in the 10 rock spot. It should be over by cancel. The use cases that you can sort of folk at common conditions like you might have FHA or like your example of like Miami condos.It it's just a way to not have to manually search for them every single time. Yeah, great. But they like to do things in both, like, oh, I know it's this type of loan. I don't want to have to, as Mark pointed out, I can search for them all individually. I just want to.That might go to see best.Yeah, it's like that little feature is today. That could be a 30 minute job of going into an Excel spreadsheet, copying. OK, I need this one, I need this one. So I mean these little like quality of life is really what's going to sell this product.One other thing. Oh yeah, got it. And so the the underwriters have a different set of rules in the rule engine. So they would run their automated conditions again and and so I'm I'm less clear on the rules. Yeah, so this this would work like let's say that there was a.It changed it alone, ended up having to change one programs, for example, and that results in different conditions. Rather than having to manually go through and add those conditions, remove other ones, we can they can.Run the the rules engine on demand borrowers these lists basically. Yeah, these lists and identify which conditions to add and remove with those recommendations in front of them. They can decide what they want to do with those and then this will do and this will actually do it. I just had it sort of randomly.Select conditions to add. Oh, OK, so nice. So Kelly Maddox mentioned in the very beginning that this should happen automatically on C.I think the problem is like, I'm just throwing that. Yeah, like who's saving? I think. I think minimum what we could probably do is we could prompt and recommend that somebody run this when you open the screen. But if you do it on save, the problem is there's too many places to save and I don't want to randomly pop a conditions window for like.Like the wrong people. So I would argue as a phase two, if we know that a loan is dirty, it's been modified and it and this is a recommended step that we could maybe flash the the whatever button this was to say, oh maybe we recommend you know XYZ has changed.We recommend that you rerun this engine or something and we want to like persist that flashing until they put it like if they like lean or go away and come back, yeah, it should flash when they when they load. It's an outstanding like to do, yes. So I got a mechanism to make it flash stays or we have to like track that it's the flash.But yeah, I I do know when we talked about this past there was quite a bit of concern around doing an auto run. I thought Kelly was concerned about it too. I actually she just won't because by the time somebody clicks a button it may be too late. So I think that was.It's her thought process because if if you have to wait for something to get in a file, to click a button, to see something, to go chase down a document, yeah, you're behind the stuff that's alone. So it's just the concern was that it might remove the wrong stuff, right?Well, I mean, we can, we can figure out the reconciliation logic, right? Yeah, the thought process, it's the data's there. Yeah, it's already there.Yeah, and sidebar. Oh, it's a discussion. Yeah, we did meet with Kelly and she had, I think she called it her cardinal rules. So I I built that into the deck and maybe we can go that over that like tomorrow or something. But she has like 5 call outs concerns. We can even invite her to.Dial in maybe. I think she'd love that. Yeah, she would really love that. Yeah. So we met with her and she definitely had concerns. But if, yeah, if she could be part of the conversation, I think that would be, um, super helpful. And for those who don't know, Kelly is our, she owns the Byte platform. So she's like the expert when it comes to Byte and just generally conditions. So she's gonna be a good resource, Yeah.17 years. Oh yeah, she knows everything. She's like the bite queen, but she knows everything. She knows too much. I know. She always identifies all the obstacles. And yeah, so it can be challenging. OK, so we just ran the automated conditions. And again, this is a different.A set of rules that only the underwriter has access to. So it will give you recommendations. You can deselect and then we'll click on add, remove and then they will add that. And so at this point I'm the underwriter. I've reviewed my docs. I've added some conditions that I think were missing.And then I'm I'm gonna update the loan status again and again. I'm gonna anytime you update the status, it's gonna ask you to do a note and then I'm assume that I'm now as the underwriter putting it into an approved status and again.The only thing that happens in the loan portal is you put a note and then it'll take you to the the byte status page. Too nuanced to that depending on the state of the loan. It's not the prototype or even the Figma prototype. I'd have to show you the individual screens.OK.We didn't use that. OK, a document that I was like, yeah, let's let's let's do green fill or what's it called? Happy path, happy path. And then we'll we'll talk about the the deep dive just so we can get through it all. Or do we need to stop for lunch? We why don't we break and then and then.Why don't we let's do quick questions like like Q&A and then and then in about 10 minutes we'll start to if you any. Does everybody want to go to lunch or anybody opting out? Gene, are you joining us for lunch?I thought you were. I thought you were. You're still gonna pay for it though, right? So just leave me there. I mean, we don't. We don't actually want you there. Just kidding. I've got all of this.What questions? OK, I don't eat. I'm kidding. OK, there are salad options. I need more of that salad. OK, there's a free pass. Yes, there's a free pass. Recommendation next door PF Chang's.Uh, might have more vegan options, but hmm, I don't wanna ruin it for everyone else. Y'all. It's OK. OK, well, either either way. Uh.I don't think anybody was like set or excited about like super excited about the range. I it's just something I picked because it was close. I'm saying what questions based on.Or or or when we come back, I think what we'll do, I want to we'll walk through the final use cases there. But I think generally speaking is this kind of a is this helpful or are we is this a good sort of?Speed and all of that. Are we technical enough or or high level enough for you guys? Yes, OK, it's been very helpful for me.OK. So we'll do lunch and then we'll come back and we'll keep going. And I already asked Scott that question. Which one? I I think we'll, we'll get it. Hey, Carlos, do you have any, any questions?Or are you still over? I I see you here, yeah.Carlos Sanchez   2:36:43I don't. I am fading. I don't have any. No, I don't have any questions. It's a pretty good prototype and kind of getting the idea of what we're trying to do so.Leslie Chang   2:36:47Oh.Leslie Chang stopped transcription
